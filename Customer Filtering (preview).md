# Customer Filtering (preview)

While making product recommendations, predicting customer churn or predicting your customers lifetime value, you may identify cases where only a certain group of people is appropriate for the type of predictions you are making. As an example, you may want to identify customers that have specific preference for a type of service or product and deliver a subset of products to those customers, increasing the personalization in the recommendations to your customers.  

 

## Prerequisites

- At least [Contributor permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/audience-insights/permissions) in Customer Insights.
