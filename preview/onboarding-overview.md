# Onboard to the Product Insights private preview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The goal of this onboarding document is to give Private Preview customers visibility into our product features, documentation, scenarios to validate, known issues and how to engage with Microsoft throughout the Private Preview. Nothing in this documentation is meant to, or should be construed to, modify the terms of your agreements with Microsoft, including your Preview Terms.

## Onboarding overview

*	Review and agree to the [NDA and Preview Agreement](preview-terms.md) with Microsoft.  
*	Review [capabilities outlined in this article](#private-preview-features) for Private Preview.  
*	Review and understand the [expectations](#private-preview-expectations) and [known issues](#known-issues) of the Private Preview.  
*	Validate the [core scenarios](#product-use-cases-to-test) and provide feedback to Microsoft.

## Private Preview expectations

*	Private Preview is for testing purposes only. Environments may be taken down at the end of the testing period to make way for future releases. See the [Preview Terms of Service](preview-terms.md) for more disclosures and limitations.  
*	Private Preview is not for production use, but rather is strictly for prototyping and providing feedback. We are likely to delete data and rebuild environments at any point during the Private Preview, but will make reasonable efforts to ensure communication of any changes to avoid disruption in testing.   
*	We will work closely with you to seek feedback and incorporate product changes. We expect to establish a cadence for this interaction during the period of Private Preview and will communicate that subsequently.  
*	Private Preview is expected to run approximately for two months (August - September 2020) and we appreciate your active participation. We plan to consider all relevant feedback  in developing future releases.  
*	Please reach out to your assigned product manager first or use the email **[pirequest@microsoft.com](mailto:pirequest@microsoft.com)** to provide feedback and report issues. We will use reasonable efforts to triage reported issues, prioritize them, track them, and share a status with you regularly.  
	
## Prerequisites

## User consent for use of cookies
