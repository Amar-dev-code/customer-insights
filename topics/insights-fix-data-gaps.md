# Fix data gaps
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If you have a data set that is missing values, you can use the interpolation feature of Product Insights to fill them in.

## Example

1. Select an incomplete data set in which some points are missing or not connected.
2. Select **Fix data gaps** from the **Suggestions** provided under your chart (see video below).  
3. Enable the **Fix data** feature to automatically configure your chart and fix any data gaps.
4. Product Insights will interpolate missing data points according to the current operation (such as **Average**) and complete your chart.
