# Fix data gaps

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If your data set is missing values, you can use Product Insights' interpolation feature to fill them in.

## Example

1. Select an incomplete data set, in which some points are missing or not connected.
2. Select **Fix data gaps** from the **Suggestions** provided under your chart (see video below). Alternatively, select **More** from the left side of the screen, and select **Fix**.
3. Product Insights will interpolate missing data points according to the current operation (such as **Average**) and complete your chart.
