# Collaborate on your insights
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With Product Insightâ€™s built-in collaboration capabilities, you can easily go from insight to action. When you discover an important insight while exploring your data, comment on your findings right away and assign a colleague to take a look.  You can even set a due date if necessary. The individual you name in the task will automatically receive a notification and can comment on the insight via the same interface.
