# Collaborate on your insights

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

With Product Insightâ€™s built-in collaboration capabilities, you can easily go from insights to action.

When you discover an important insight, or simply have questions about the data you're seeing, you can comment on your findings and assign tasks to colleagues from within the data view. You can even set a due date, if desired. Your team members will be automatically notified when you request their attention, and can respond via the same interface.
