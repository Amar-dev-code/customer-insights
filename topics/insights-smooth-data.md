# Smooth data

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Some signals are noisy, and that can make it hard to detect trends at a glance.

Product Insights features several built-in methods to reduce noise, and to smooth out variability and outliers. By assigning more weight to your latest data and reacting faster to recent changes, trends become much easier to spot.

Choose an automatic time grain to let the system find the optimal window size.

## Example

1. Select the data set you want to smooth.
2. Select a **Mode** from the **Smooth** menu. If you select **Auto**, Product Insights will choose the optimal smoothing mode for your situation via AI.
3. Product Insights will smooth the data on your chart according to the method you've selected.
