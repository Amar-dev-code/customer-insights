# GDPR/ Compliance

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Background

The European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that has been applied since May 25, 2018, gives significant rights to individuals with regards to their data. The GDPR is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. You can read more about Microsoft's commitment to security at the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center).

## Deleting and exporting signal data containing personal identifiable information

The following sections describe how to delete and export signal data that may contain personal identifiable information (PII).

### Overview

Dynamics 365 Product Insights is committed to helping our customers meet their GDPR requirements, such as the right to delete and export data that includes PII (like user IDs, phone numbers, and email addresses). Team administrators are enabled to execute user requests regarding the deleting or exporting of their personal data, ensuring that Product Insights complies with GDPR requirements.

There is a two-step process to delete or export data:

1. Tag signal properties that contain PII data.
2. Delete or export data associated with specific PII values (for example: a specified user ID).

### Tag signal properties

PII data is tagged on a signal property level. You'll first need to tag the properties being considered for deletion or export.

To tag a signal property as containing PII, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the project that the signal belongs to.

  
1. Select the signal you want to tag to reach the signal's **Overview** page.

1. Select **[...]** and then **Edit** to reach the **Update Property** window.

1. In the **Update Property** window, select **[...]** in the upper right corner, and check the **Contains PII** box. Select **Update** to save your changes.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Every time the signal schema changes or a new signal is created, it's recommended that you evaluate the associated signal properties and tag or untag them as containing PII data, if necessary.

### Delete or export tagged signal data

For Private Preview, please email delete requests to **ariapm@microsoft.com**. We are currently working on the functionality that will enable you delete tagged signal data on your own. Stay tuned!

#### Good Practices

* Try to avoid sending any signals that contain PII data.
* If you do need to send signals containing PII data, make sure to limit the number of signals and signal properties containing PII data as much as possible. Ideally, limit yourself to one such signal.
* Make sure that as few people as possible have access to the sent PII data.
* For signals containing PII data, make sure that you set one property to emit a unique identifier that can easily be linked to a specific user (for example: a user ID). This makes it much easier to segregate data, and to export or delete the right data.
* Only tag one property per signal as containing PII data, ideally one that only contains a unique identifier
* Do not tag properties containing verbose values (for example: an entire request body). Product Insights uses exact string matching when deciding which signals to delete or export.
