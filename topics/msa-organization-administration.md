# How to administer an organization using a Microsoft account

A Microsoft Service Account (MSA) user can have access to multiple organizations in Product Insights. Users can switch organizations by clicking on the **Organization Switcher** component on the home page. The organization switcher will list all organizations users as either admins or members. 
Click on **Settings** (the gear icon) to load the organization administration page.
