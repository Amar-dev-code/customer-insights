# Explore your data

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Product Insights makes it easy to see and understand the data coming in from your products in real-time.

Get an overview of all your signals and their properties in your project's **Signals** tab, and then drill down to a specific signal to observe the data as it arrives.

To further investigate a signal, select **Explore** from the signal's **Overview** page. Here you can slice, dice, and group your data to derive insights. Views created in this way can be published to a dashboard and shared with your team.  

View this video to learn how to explore your data.
