# Concepts and terminology

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear frequently in Product Insights and in its supporting documentation.

## Attribute

Metadata for a property of an object, element, or file.

## Derived signal

A derived signal is a virtual view of a base signal. Derived signals are generally used for scoping down a base signal for export, or for cleaning up a signal containing properties that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Environment

A space in which to store, manage, and share an organization's business data, apps, and flows.

## Event

A single occurrence of data sent to Product Insights. If you think of a **signal** as a flowing stream of data, an event is that stream at a specific point in time.

## Member

A member is assigned as a way of managing users’ permission to a Project. Currently Product Insights only has the role of “Owner”, which allows the user to manage the project, view reports, and manage data.

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Examples of relevant metrics in Product Insights include page views or average time spent on site.

## Project

A project is a way of grouping data and reports in Product Insights. New projects include pre-configured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.

## Report

A report is a collection of charts. There are several out-of-the-box reports defined for a web project.

## Signal

Data sent to Product Insights from an outside source, such as a website, mobile app, or IoT device. Signals provide a continuous flow of data that can be analyzed for real-time insights into how customers use and experience your product.
