# Create a project

To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Select **+New Project** in the bottom-left corner of the portal.

2. Enter your project's **Name** and any **Description** text you desire.

3. Select **Create** to confirm.

## Add members

The **Members** page is where you'll assign members to your projects, and define their roles and permissions for using Dynamics 365 Customer Analytics across your organization.

To add members to your project, follow these steps:

1. Select **Settings** > **Members**, then select the **+Add members** button.

2. Use the **Members** field to find users in your organization who you want to add to your team. You can search by name or email address. Under **Role**, the only currently available option is **Owner**.

**Note:** Security and Distribution Groups are not supported at this time.

3. When you are done adding users, select **Add** to confirm.
