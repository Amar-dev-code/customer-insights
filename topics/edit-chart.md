With Product Insights, it's easy to visualize your important business data and to create insightful, collaborative charts and graphics.

First, select the signal you want to view in chart form. The **Data** tab on the left side of the screen contains options to help you filter and manipulate relevant information:

* Filter your properties of interest with **Where**.
* Choose the values you want to **Measure**.
* Create smart property groupings with **Group by**.
* Transform your data with **Smooth**.
* Measure your data's change rates with **Show change**.

Other utilities to support your exploration are available under **More**.

## Change your chart's properties

Data is displayed as a line chart by default. For a different view of your data, select **Line** from the dropdown and choose an alternate chart type. Similarly, the time range and increment values can be adjusted to your desired frequency.

## Automated insight suggestions

Below your chart, our AI-powered engine provides **Suggestions** to help you view your data through additional lenses and discover new insights.

To apply a suggestion, simply select it. You can always **Undo** or **Redo** changes to your chart.
