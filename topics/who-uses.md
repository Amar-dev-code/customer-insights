# <a id="who_uses"></a>Who is using Product Insights and how?

Microsoft products and services like Xbox, Skype, Office, and Bing use Product Insights to transform product-related business processes. Slow, reactive processes that are driven by manual customer feedback turn into fast, proactive processes. These processes are powered by automated observational data from the product itself. 

 Product Insights enable the following scenarios for these businesses:

 
1. **Proactive repair**: businesses improve their ability to rapidly identify top problems in their product or service and prioritize repairs or design fixes using telemetry. They diagnose issues in the field, verify repairs, and drive proactive maintenance.

2. **Continuous improvement**: businesses measure quality and customer experience, identify improvements, gauge the customers who would benefit, and prioritize improvements accordingly. Over time, teams also build intuition about their customers and products.
	
3. **Product planning**: businesses inform their planning of new releases and new products and services using data to identify unmet needs, model the benefit of proposed projects, analyze ROI, and engage prospective customers for ideas and feedback.

4. **Usage growth**: businesses discover which features create excitement and drive the retention and what causes churn in new or existing users. They can optimize the conversion rate, streamline user flows, and reach out to customers at risk of churn.
