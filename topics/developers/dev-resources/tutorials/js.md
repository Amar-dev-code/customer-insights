# Web/React (JavaScript)
 
## Prerequisites

* [API token](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/product-insights/developers/dev-resources/tutorials/api-token)
* Hosted project or webpage to send telemetry. Telemetry from a local file will not be accepted by the server.

## Code sample

[Download JavaScript code sample](https://ariamediahost.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/ProductInsightsSamples/ProductInsightsJavascriptSample.zip)

### Running the sample

1. Open the file in Visual Studio Code and add the instrumentation key.
2. [Install Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
3. Select Alt+L, Alt+O to launch the HTML page in a local server and Alt+L, Alt+C to stop the server. (Under Mac OS select Cmd+L, Cmd+O and Cmd+L, Cmd+C.)

## Integrate

1. Add the SDK to your page using the script tag: TBD:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://1dsjssdk.blob.core.windows.net/scripts/latest/ms.analytics-1-beta.js"> 
</script> 
```

2. Start the SDK (you only need to do this once)
3. Replace `Your-API-Token` with your project's instrumentation key.

```javascript
Var analytics = new ApplicationInsights(); 
var config = { 
    instrumentationKey: "Your-API-Token" 
};

analytics.initialize(config, []); 
```

4. Track events:

```javascript
// Do a simple track call. 
analytics.track({ 
    name: "my_simple_event_name", 
    data: { 
        "Name": "Ashley Smith", 
        "School": "Bellevue High School", 
        "Grade": 11, 
        "Gpa": 3.82, 
        "Suspended": false 
    } 
}); 
```
5. We recommend that you teardown the SDK when your application closes. This ensures that events currently in queue are sent. Note that if the browser supports HTML5 Beacons, we will use Beacons to send events for greater reliability.
   
```analytics.getPostChannel().teardown();```

## Types

The following types are supported for event properties:

* **String**
* **Double**
* **boolean**
