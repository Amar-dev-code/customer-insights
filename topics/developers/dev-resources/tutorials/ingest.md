# Getting started with the CSV Sender

The CSV Sender can be used to send data from a comma-separated value file to Product Insights.

The first line of the CSV file must contain the header that specifies the field names.
Each subsequent line in the CSV file must contain data (field values) for one event.

## Download the CSV Sender

To download the tool, click the following link.

[Download the CSV Sender](https://ariamediahost.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/ProductInsightsSenders/ProductInsights_PowerShellTool.zip)

## Run the CSV Sender

You can run the CSV Sender in PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
.\IngestionTool.ps1 -CsvFile YOUR_CSV_FILE -TimestampColumnName birthday -ApiKey Your_API_Key -EventName EventName -Timezone "Eastern Standard Time"
```

The `-CsvFile`, `-ApiKey`, and `-EventName` parameters are mandatory.

If you run the CSV Sender in the directory where you put it, it
will print the results on screen.

## Get a project key

To find `YOUR_API_KEY`, follow instructions [here](xref:developers/downloads/api-token)

## Changing PowerShell script execution policy 

Users may not able to run the tool directly due to PowerShell security strategy on Windows computers. 

To change the execution policy for LocalMachine, start PowerShell with ‘Run as Administator’, then run “Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted” (this is one-time operation). For more details please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-6

If this fails, you can try "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser", then specify "Unrestricted". Please note this should be a one-time operation, and should not be the default. 

## For more information

For more details on running this program, type `help .\IngestionTool`
in your PowerShell window.

To use a separate schema file, refer to the [Ingestion Data Scheme document](xref:developers/downloads/ingestion-data-scheme).
