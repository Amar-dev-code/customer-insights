Do you have a metric that you are tracking with Aria? You can create thresholds that are considered acceptable, and when the threshold is breached, Aria will fire automatic alerts. The general procedure is as follows.
1. [Create a health model]({{ howtoLink}}/health-mon-get-started)
1. [Create a health metric]({{ howtoLink}}/health-mon-metrics)
1. [Set up notifications]({{ howtoLink}}/user-role)

Here is a short introductory video that explains health monitoring.
