Create your own {{ site.brandname }} project and send your first telemetry events in five minutes or less.

## Create a project

Create a project from either the [Instrument Wizard]({{ site.portal_url }}/instrument/project){: target="_blank" } or the [welcome screen]({{ site.portal_url }}/welcome-screen){: target="_blank" }. Name your project, and then optionally skip the wizard.

Alternatively, find one of your existing projects.

This is the project management screen. Here you can see your project's settings, as well as information about your project's ingestion status. Make note of your project key. It is the access token that you will use to send telemetry to Aria.
