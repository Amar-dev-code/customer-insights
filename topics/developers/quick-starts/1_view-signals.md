# Locate, view, and explore signals 

A signal is a continuous flow of data. If your team is using Product Insights, you are likely to find signals for your team's projects. 

In this section, you will learn to find signals, examine the contents of a signal, then learn to interact with the signal to get insights. We will be working with sample data for Fabrikam Tech automobile company.
