# View signals 

Product Insights enables business to send data from a variety of sources such as products, websites, and mobile applications. This continuous flow of data is referred to as signals. A project typically has multiple signals flowing in, and a user who has permission can view, and explore the signals. 

In this section, you will learn how to find and explore signals sent to a sample project named Fabrikam Go.

1. Log in. If you are not sure how, refer to [this section](what-is). 
2. From the landing page, click on Product Summary team on the left. 
3. Product Summary team's projects are listed. Select Fabrikam Automobiles.
