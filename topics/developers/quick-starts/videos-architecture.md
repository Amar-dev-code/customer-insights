sub_title: How we do big data at Aria - under the hood

---

We have a number of videos that explain how we do big data that can process millions of events per second coming from nearly a billion devices. We also cover advanced topics such as how to better optimize data sending.

This topic contains the following video tutorials:

[SDK](#sdk-how-our-sdk-works)
: How our SDK works.

[Pipeline](#pipeline-how-we-handle-10-million-events-per-second-and-process-the-data)
: How we handle 10 million events per second, and process the data.

[Concurrency](#concurrency-architecture-for-our-real-time-aggregation-engine---how-to-handle-concurrency)
: Architecture for our real-time aggregation engine - how to handle concurrency.

[Preaggs](#preaggs-a-trick-for-super-fast-responses-to-large-queries)
: A trick for super-fast responses to large queries.

[HyperLogLog](#hyperloglog-the-black-magic-behind-effective-distinct-counting)
: The black magic behind effective distinct counting.

[Configurations](#configurations-at-this-scale-even-configurations-must-be-scaled-up)
: At this scale, even configurations must be scaled-up.
