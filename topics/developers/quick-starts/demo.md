See [Aria SDK code samples](/developers/downloads/aria-sdk-samples){: target="_blank" } for a list of complete application development projects that you can use as learning aids (that you can study, compile, and run). Each one demonstrates how to instrument a basic application using a particular flavor of the Aria SDK.

We also have two demo apps for you to play with:

* [Calling app simulator](/developers/downloads/calling-app-simulator/){: target="_blank" }
* [Memory game](/developers/downloads/memory-game/){: target="_blank" }
