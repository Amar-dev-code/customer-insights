title: Getting started with funnels

---

Real-time funnels enable product owners to measure the progress of users through important workflows in their application.  Over __15 Microsoft Office teams__ including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and Skype, are already using the over 300 real-time funnels they have created.

## How can funnels benefit my team?

## How can I create my first funnel?

To benefit from the real-time funnel feature, your product’s telemetry must flow into Aria, either through a routing layer such as Nexus (used by many Office client teams, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint), or with the Aria SDKs (used by teams such as OneNote and Outlook Mobile).

- __Learn:__ Visit the [funnel tutorial][1] which includes two-minute tutorial videos, to learn about how to create a real-time funnel.
- __Create:__ If you know your way around, you can [create funnels on Aria][2]{: target="_blank" }.


### Some good examples of funnels

1.	__Outlook Mobile signup funnel:__
Five-step funnel that measures the success rate of the signup process in Outlook Mobile apps.

2.	__Skype phone number verification funnel:__
Six-step funnel that measures the success rate when a customer submits a phone number, gets the PIN, and submits it in the app to confirm their phone number.

3.	__Office.com promotion success funnel:__
Three-step funnel that measures the rate of customers reacting to certain promotions on the Office.com website.

### Evernote to OneNote wizard example

The Evernote to OneNote import wizard funnel is a great example funnel. Evernote users can migrate to OneNote using a simple four-step wizard. The steps of this funnel include the Welcome page, Sign in page, Import Progress page, and Success page.

### Import wizard screenshots (below)

These show the user interface and how funnel conversion rates are associated with them.

### Aria UI screenshot of the funnel steps

These show the funnel conversion rate charts that correspond with each step of the user flow.
