# Define your own insight 

When you were exploring, you shaped signals to give you MPG per vehicle fuel type. This is a useful insight that can continue to be useful. You can add it to your arsenal of insight by turning it into a metric. 

Once it is published as a metric, you can easily share this insight with others. They can also easily use it in their charts.
