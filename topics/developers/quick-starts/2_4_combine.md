# Combine metrics

You can use your metric and other published metrics to get deeper insights. 

Let's compare average trips made for cars in two different cities. You can see that there is a distinct pattern. In cities where there are many ride-sharing vehicles, number of trips and total mileage travelled stays high all throughout the week. For other cities, total mileage peaks at commute times.
