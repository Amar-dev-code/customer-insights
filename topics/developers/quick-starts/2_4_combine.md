# Combine metrics

You can analyze your metric with other published metrics to get deeper insights.

Let's compare average trips made for cars in two different cities. You can see that there is a distinct pattern. In cities where there are many ride-sharing vehicles, number of trips and total mileage travelled stay high throughout the week. For other cities, total mileage peaks at commute times.
