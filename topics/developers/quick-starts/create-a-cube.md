Cubes are central to our data pipeline. They define which aggregate operations we will perform, and what data will be available when creating dashboards.

To create a cube, select a project from which the cube will be collecting data. From the explorer, click on the plus button at the bottom and choose a cube.

Give your cube a name, and select measures and dimensions you need to compute your metrics. If you are not familiar with these concepts, please refer to the videos above.
