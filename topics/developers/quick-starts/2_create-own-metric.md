# Create your own metric  

Having seen the raw signals coming through, you decide that you would like to see which cars cost the least to run in terms of fuel. In other words, you would like to see MPG (or MPGe* for electric cars!) values for the cars. 

We can find this value, create a persistent metric, and publish this metric to ensure it is reusable and sharable in five minutes. 

These instructions follow from the end of the previous section, [Explore signals](xref:developers/quick-starts/1_3_explore). 

1. On the **Signals** details page, open the chart editor by selecting **Explore** at the top right corner of the screen.

*MPGe: miles per gallon gasoline equivalent
