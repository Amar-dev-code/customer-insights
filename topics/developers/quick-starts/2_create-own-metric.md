# Create your own metric  

1. Open viz editor. We will try to get average mileage per city type 
2. Select a signal 
3. Select 'average' 
4. Select 'mileage' 
5. So far, we have average MPG for all the vehicles. We will try to get MPG per fuel type, e.g. electric, gas, sedan. Select split. 
6. Select city types. 
7. Select save to save it as a metric.
8. Publish metric. Now you can re-use this metric in other charts, or share it with your colleagues. 

Once it is published as a metric, you can easily share this insight with others. They can also use it in their charts.
