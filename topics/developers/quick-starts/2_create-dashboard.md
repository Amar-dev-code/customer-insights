# Analyze your data by creating a dashboard

Dashboards are a way for you to organize analysis on various signals that are important to your business or organization, primarily in the form of multiple charts. Share your dashboard with individuals within your organization or your whole team, and collaborate on this dashboard.  

There are two paths to publishing to a dashboard:
1.	You could explore your data and then promote it to become a dashboard chart. 
2.	You could create a chart directly and then publish to a dashboard.

Watch how to create a dashboard and publish a chart to your dashboard.
