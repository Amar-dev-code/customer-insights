# Create a dashboard

Dashboards are a way for you to collect information about various signals and metrics that are important to your business, primarily in the form of multiple charts. Once you have created a dashboard, you can keep it private or share it with your colleagues or your whole company.

1. Select the **Create** button. Your project's screen will appear.
1. Select your new dashboard's name from your project's screen. A screen will appear with the instructions, "Create the first chart." This screen is the first page of your new dashboard.
