# Slice and dice signals

## Select dimensions to drill down deeper 

You can see the MPGe (miles per gallon gasoline equivalent) for each vehicle fuel type. Using the `vehicle_drive_end` signal, select the property `mpg`. Then select **Add Split**. Select `vehicle_fuel_type`. Now you can see average MPGe values for electric, hybrid, and gas vehicles.
