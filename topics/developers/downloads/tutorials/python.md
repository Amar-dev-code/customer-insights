# Getting started with Python
 
## Installing dependencies
As this is the Python SDK, the only required dependency is Python! The SDK supports both Python 2.7 and 3.x. There are no further dependencies, as they are bundled with the SDK.

## Installing the SDK
There are two primary ways to use the Python SDK:
* Install the SDK to your Python interpreter's `site-packages` folder, or
* Place the [SDK `.egg` file](https://ariamediahost.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/ProductInsightsSamples/aria-2.0.0.egg) 
somewhere and add it to `sys.path`
 
This page describes how to do both.

#### Installing to site-packages
1. Open your terminal and `cd` to the directory containing the file `aria-x.y.z.egg`.
2. Run `python -m easy_install aria-x.y.z.egg`
3. Import the SDK
```python
import aria
from aria import LogManager, EventProperties
```

#### Adding to the Import Path
The SDK can also be used without installation using only the `.egg` file.
In any Python script, add the following code recipe to use the SDK:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/aria-x.y.z.egg')
 
# Import the SDK!
import aria
from aria import LogManager, EventProperties
```
 
## Using the SDK
While a full example can be seen in the SDK's [sample.py file](sample.py), the basic usage pattern is demonstrated here.
 
```python
from aria import LogManager, EventProperties, PiiKind
 
# Initialize the SDK and get a logger
# Use your actual tenant token - it will be longer than this example
logger = LogManager.initialize('0123456789abcdef-01234567-89abcdef')
 
# Create an event
event = EventProperties('some_event_name')
 
# Fill the event values
event.set_property('rpm', 50)
event.set_property('device_name', 'Test Device 9000')
event.set_property('active', True)
 
# Maybe even set a PII (Personally Identifiable Information) value
# This value will be obfuscated on upload, and will be unreadable
event.set_property('username', 'SuperCoolUsername_42', pii_kind=PiiKind.PiiKind_DistinguishedName)
 
# Log the event
logger.log_event(event)
```
 
Keep in mind that the SDK batches events and uploads them periodically rather than immediately (by default, a little over three times per second) when calling `log_event()`.
 
To force all events to be uploaded, call
```python
LogManager.flush()
```
 
Before your program exits, call
```python
LogManager.flush_and_tear_down()
```
 
This convenience method flushes the SDK and ensures it shuts down cleanly.
