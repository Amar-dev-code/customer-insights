# Getting started with the CSV Sender

The CSV Sender can be used to send data from a comma-separated value file to Product Insights.

The first line of the CSV file must contain the header that specifies the field names.
Each subsequent line in the CSV file must contain data (field values) for one event.

## Download the CSV Sender

To download the tool, click the following link.

[Download the CSV Sender](https://ariamediahost.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/ProductInsightsSenders/ProductInsights_PowerShellTool.zip)

## Run the CSV Sender

You can run the CSV Sender in PowerShell as follows:

```powershell
.\IngestionTool.ps1 -CsvFile YOUR_CSV_FILE -schema YOUR_SCHEMA_FILE -EventName YOUR_EVENT_NAME -ApiToken YOUR_API_KEY
```

The `-CsvFile` and `-ApiToken` parameters are mandatory, and the user
must provide either the `-schema` or `-EventName` parameter.

> **Note**: Provide a -schema parameter if you already have a data schema defined
> according to the [Ingestion Data Scheme](https://www.aria.ms/developers/downloads/IngestionDataScheme). 
> Alternatively, you can simply provide an event name for the data you are sending, and a schema will be auto-generated. 
> To override the system timestamp, you will need a custom schema. 
> Without a schema, all events will have the ingestion time set to the timestamp.

If you run the CSV Sender in the directory where you put it, it
will print the results on screen.

## Get a project key

To find `YOUR_API_KEY`, you'll create a project (previously known as
tenant), which generates a project key (a string of hexadecimal
digits) that you'll use to authenticate your app to Product Insights. Visit the
Product Insights Instrument Wizard and follow the instructions on the first page.
For **Project**, specify the name of your local project or solution.
On the second page, select any platform and click **Skip this wizard**.
On the third page, copy the Ingestion Key. Use it for your 
API token.
