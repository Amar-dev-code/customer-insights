# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## What are the service limits?

There is a default ingestion quota of 5,000 events per second and a Kusto database of 1 GiB.

## Why are some of my events not showing up in the viewer?

The event viewer was designed to provide a quick sample of your events for you to debug instrumentation and get examples of events. It was not intended to be a generic query engine. At low volumes, it will capture and return every event. At high volumes, it will capture and return a sample of your recent events.

## What is an SDK?

An SDK is a Software Development Kit. Several SDKs are [available for Product Insights](../downloads/index.md), including ones for Android, C#, iOS, and JavaScript. These SDKs will enable you to send data programmatically to Product Insights from their respective platforms.

For alternative ways of sending data, see TK.

## What is a project?

A project is a customer unit within Product Insights. A project sends data, owns its data, and uses its data. Once you create a project, you are the customer of Product Insights, and as that customer (project), you will be using Product Insights services. A project is usually a team, single service, application, or shared library.

## I can't see my data!

If you are sending data to Product Insights with an SDK, make sure your application is correctly integrated with App Insights and App Center. 

## Why is there a quota on my project? 

Product Insights customers receive 1 million events per month at no additional charge.
After that, events are billed on a linear scale.

## What happens when my project is throttled?

Once the project has exceeded its quota beyond some grace period, the Product Insights Collector will start rejecting events from its clients. Transient spikes in traffic are unlikely to trigger throttling. The SDK on the client will retry the upload until it reaches the maximum queue size or it exceeds the max retry count.

## What would happen if a malicious hacker snooped and got my tenant’s ingestion token?

If the hacker knew the Product Insights schema, how to serialize to bond, and also our collector protocol, they could send junk events, thereby increasing event count. This could have an impact on distinct user count, or possibly cause a denial of service attack. We suggest that you replace the compromised token.

## What do I do if my tenant’s ingestion token is compromised?

You can remove the compromised token from your code, and replace it with a new token.
