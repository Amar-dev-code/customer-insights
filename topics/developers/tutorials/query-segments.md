## What are segments?

When you want to visualize data from your cubes, you'd typically show numeric values (measures), per certain dimension. So you'd perhaps see number of clicks per country. To select the dimension you want, you use filters and splits.

When you use certain sets of dimensions often, you can group them together into a 'segment'. Therefore if you tend to group the dimensions 'red', 'blue', and 'yellow', you could create a segment called 'primary colours' that would automatically select the three dimensions as a single set.

This means you can re-use the configuration later to select the same data subset. Segments are very useful if you reuse your dimension selection often. Another example is, if you often select 10 different countries for "Western Europe" values, then save it as a 'W Europe' segment.
