# Getting Started with the Product Insights CDS Enrichment

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using a Product Insights Common Data Service (CDS) enrichment capability, which will allow you to enrich the real-time signals from sources like IoT with additional fields that are sourced from CDS.

The data ingested is limited to just two fields from CDS: `ProductId` from product entity and `AssetId` from asset entity.

## Prerequisites
* Dynamics Field service subscription
  * To obtain free trial subscription:
    1. Sign up at [Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://trials.dynamics.com).
    2. Join an existing trial or create a new tenant.
    3. To view the environment, go to `https://<tenant_name>.crm.dynamics.com`

## Configuring CDS Enrichment
1. Select your project.
2. Select **Settings** under your project.
3. Scroll to **Enrichment Sources**.

5. Enter the name for CDS enrichment.
6. Enter CDS endpoint URL (`https://<tenant_name>.api.crm.dynamics.com`) and replace `<tenant_name>` with field service tenant name.
7. Select the CDS enrichment refresh frequency.
8. Enter the CDS products entity enrichment:
    * Enter the signal property name.
    * Enter the Products entity property name that matches the signal property name.
        * When the value of the signal property and product property matches, the `Signal.Product.Id` will be enriched with real-time signal.
        * To view the available products from CDS, follow these steps:
            1. Log onto Field Service (`https://<tenant_name>.crm.dynamis.com`)
            2. Open new tab and launch `https://<tenant_name>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/products`

9. Enter the optional CDS Asset(`msdyn_customerassets`) entity enrichment.
    * Enter the asset entity property name that matches the signal property name.
        * When the value of signal property and asset property matches, the `Signal.Asset.Id` will be enriched with real-time signal.
        * To view the available products from CDS, follow these steps:
            1. Log onto Field Service (`https://<tenant_name>.crm.dynamis.com`)
            2. Open new tab and launch `https://<tenant_name>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/msdyn_customerassets`

10. Select **Create**. 

Based on the user token, the CDS enrichment will be scheduled.
