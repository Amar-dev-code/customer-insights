# Run comparisons

Comparing the number of items (such as calls) to a previous period is often the first transform to try. Select a comparison, then choose which period you will compare it to. You can select the number of days or weeks. The graph will update with another series from the time period of your choice.

## Example

1. From the **Compare** menu, select **Last week**.
2. The **Time range** field will display **One week ago**, and the chart will display the difference between this week's data and past week's data for the current measure (such as **Signal count**).
3. You can experiment with other periods on the **Compare** menu, such as **One month ago** or **Yesterday**.
