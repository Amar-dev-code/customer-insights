# Set granularity 

Data is usually bound by time on a chart. For example, you want to see last 24 hours of data, grouped by hour. In this case you will see 24 values graphed on a chart. 

You can change the date range, then 'granularity', which indicated how the data will be grouped. If you use 5 minute granularity, it will be more detailed. If you use hourly or daily granularity, it will be easier to see trends, while losing details. 

(sample screenshot for 5 min / 1hour) 

Depending on your time range, granularity will be chosen for you automatically for performance. For example, if you want last week's data, default granularity is one hour and smaller granularities such as one and five minutes may be unavailable.
