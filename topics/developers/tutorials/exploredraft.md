# Explore data with a draft

Drafts are personal explorations which are private and only viewable by you. Drafts gives you as a user, the opportunity to explore your data and choose to share your findings at will. Once ready to share, you can then publish your draft to a dashboard so that your team can view and further collaborate on it.
