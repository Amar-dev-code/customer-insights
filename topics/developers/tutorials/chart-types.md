title: Chart types

---

Charts are divided into four major types: area, bar, line, and scatter. Of these, area and bar charts support stacking.

If you have 5 red items, 3 blues, and 2 yellows, a normal area chart would show shaded areas under each value. With the "stacked" option, you'd see red marked at 5, then blue above that value at 8 (5+3), and then yellows continuing up to 10 (5+3+2). With the "100% stacked" option, you'd see reds taking up 50% of the area, followed by blue taking up 30%, and finally yellow taking up 20%. See the dashboard below for visual examples of chart types.
