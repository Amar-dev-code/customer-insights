title: Layer multiple metrics

---

Say you have a graph that shows the number of sales of your product for the US region. You want to know if it has anything to do with the investment you have made in the app. In this case, you could open the sales graph and layer the investment graph on top.
From the sales graph, simply click the **New layer** option to create a new layer. This way you can layer multiple metrics from the same cube or different cubes.
