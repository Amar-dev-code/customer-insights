# Draft: Create and edit a chart

[Insert video: Watch how to create and edit your chart]<br>

To create a chart, first select the signal you want to view in chart form, then proceed to “slice and dice” your data by selecting **measure**, **filter(s)**, **Group by**, and transforming your data using **Smooth**. If you would like to measure your data's rate change, you could use **Show change**. There are more utilities to support your exploration under the **More** section.<br> 

If you would like to see a different view of your data, you can select **Line** and choose a different chart type from the drop down. Similarly, the time range and interval can be adjusted to your desired frequency.
While editing your chart, our AI-powered engine provides hints or suggestions to help you view your data from additional dimensions (using different settings that yield viewpoints you may not have considered) and therewith provide potential next steps for your consideration. 

You can apply a hint or suggestion by selecting it, and with the **undo** button at the top right of the chart, go back in time on your action. The **redo** button simply reapplies your settings.<br>
