title: Limit to the top or Bottom N series
---

On the **Data** tab, expand **Options** to limit your graph to top or bottom N. 

The **Order By** item specifies which measure to use when ordering the series. 

The **Sort order** toggle switches between the top or bottom N.

**Limit to dropdown** sets the N value. For the top three, **Sort order Z-A**, **Limit to 3** option works. 

Watch the video below on how to use the function.
