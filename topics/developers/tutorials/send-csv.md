# Send CSV data

You can send a CSV file from the portal, either by dragging and dropping it on the interface,
or by selecting a file that is already in Azure storage.
You can also send CSV data with a command-line tool.
For more information on that tool, see [Ingestion Tool](../../developers/dev-resources/tutorials/ingest.md).
