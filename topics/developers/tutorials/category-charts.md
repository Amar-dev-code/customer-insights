## What are category charts?

By default, Aria uses time series charts. This means that the x axis is usually time, while the y axis denotes values. For example, a time series chart might show the number of users over time, one series per platform or region.

If you want to see values per category, the x axis might show Android and iOS, while the y axis shows the number of users.

To create a chart like this, click on the **View** tab, expand **Data Binding**, and set the horizontal axis for the dimension you are going to use (in the example below, Platform), to **Axis** and not **Series**.

Refer to the images below to get a better idea of how it all works:
