## Changing chart attributes with visualization options

On the main data tab of any visualisation, you will see the **Options** item, which contains the [top/bottom N](/developers/how-to/top-n-series/) feature. On the **View** tab, you will see the **Visualizations** item, where you can [change the type of your charts](/developers/how-to/chart-types/).

- __Axis settings__: On the **Horizontal Axis** and **Vertical Axis** panes, you can find customization options for all the axes.
- __Data binding__: This pane enables you to create category charts. Toggle **Series and Axis** and Aria will display a category chart instead of a standard time series graph.
- __Legend options__: You can set legends to be either automatic or alphabetical.
- __Properties__: You can change the description of your chart here.
