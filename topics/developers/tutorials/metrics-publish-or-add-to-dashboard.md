# Publish metrics

Once you have a metric that contains information you want to track, you can **Publish as metric**, or **Publish to dashboard**. The first option saves the metric to the project to be tracked continuously. With the dashboard publishing option, the chart as you have it will be added to a dashboard of your choice.
