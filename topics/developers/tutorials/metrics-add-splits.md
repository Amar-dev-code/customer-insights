# Add splits to your metric 

Splitting enables breakdown of a metric into reported categories. For example, the following split operations can be added to the previous metrics we have established: 

- To the total number of drives completed metric, add a split by clicking Split, then selecting VehicleType. Now you see total number of drives per vehicle type such as SUV, Sports, Minivan, and Sedan. 
- To the distinc count of VIN numbers metric, add a split by clicking Split, then selecting CityType. Now you see the total unique vehicles reporting in, divided into types of cities where they are located. 
- To the average MPG metric, add a split by selecting VehicleFuelType. Now you see average MPG values for electric, hybrid, and gas vehicles.
