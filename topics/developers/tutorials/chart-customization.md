## Custom colours and titles for your charts

Instead of using automatically assigned colours, you can now set custom colors and titles for your graphs. Click on the **View** tab, then expand the **Series Customization** tab. With **Overrides**, you can select a series, then set desired custom values for that series. 

Refer to the short video below to see it in action.
