# Send additional signals

Product Insights provides a variety of different options for setting up a data source service with Product Insights code 
and sending or generating signals, including [various SDK options and environments](developers/downloads), such as
Android, iOS, Python, .NET, and JavaScript. It's also possible to use a self-contained 
[CSV Sender](developers/downloads/tutorials/ingest) application to send comma-separated value data to Product Insights.
