A project (formerly known as a tenant) is typically a team or a single user account that sends a group of events and owns resources such as dashboards and cubes.

- [Create a project](/developers/get-started/create-a-project/): Create your own Aria project and send your first telemetry events in five minutes or less.

- [Create multiple projects](/developers/deep-dives/projects/): Isolate and identify telemetry streams from your clients and servicesâ€”by project.

- [Design projects](/developers/deep-dives/design-projects/): Partition the data from your apps and services into Aria projects.
