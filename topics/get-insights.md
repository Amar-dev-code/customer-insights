# Gain insights

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Product Insights helps you turn raw business data into valuable and actionable insights.

When logged in to an existing project, potentially insightful patterns and anomalies in your data are displayed on the home screen. You'll also see suggested splits and transforms you can perform on your data that may grant further clarity.

### Explore your data for insights

1. Once signals are flowing into your project, you'll see notifications on your home page.
2. Choose a signal and select **Explore** to analyze it.
3. See the suggestions that appear below the property dropdown menu and take advantage of the suite of transforms available.
4. Try using Product Insights to [smooth spiky data](insights-smooth-data.md), [run comparisons with past data](insights-run-comparisons.md), and [fix data gaps](insights-fix-data-gaps.md).
