# Embed in secure applications

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
Visuals from Product Insights dashboards can be embedded into your secure business applications—such as Dynamics 365, Teams, SharePoint, and more—using iframes. Product Insights loads embedded visuals seamlessly according to the permissions and scopes granted to the user. Anonymous sharing of Product Insights visuals is not yet available.

There are two ways visuals can be embedded using Product Insights.

## How to embed a chart

Charts that are published to dashboards can be embedded through the following steps:

1. Sign in to Product Insights.
2. Navigate to a dashboard containing the chart you would like to embed.
3. Select **(…)** on the title of the chart and select the **Embed chart** option.
4. Copy the URL from the dialog box. This will be the source URL for your iframe.

## How to embed a dashboard page

A full page (collection of visuals or charts) from a dashboard can also be embedded by following these steps:

1. Sign in to Product Insights.
2. Navigate to a dashboard containing the page you would like to embed.
3. Select **(</>) Embed Page** and copy the URL from the dialog. This will be the source URL for your iframe.
