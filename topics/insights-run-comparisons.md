# Run comparisons

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Product Insights makes it easy to compare current trends in your signal data with historic trends. From the signal's **Overview** page, select **Explore**, and then select **Compare** from the **Overlay** dropdown. Your comparison will be overlaid onto your existing chart.

Try comparing the number of items (such as calls) from one period to a previous period. Change the duration of the comparison by again selecting **Compare** in the top left corner of the chart.
