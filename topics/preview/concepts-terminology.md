# Concepts and common terms

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( ../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and in its supporting documentation.

## Events

Data sent to the engagement insights capability from an outside source, such as a website, mobile app, or IoT device. Events provide a continuous flow of data to get real-time insights into how customers use and experience your product. An event is a single occurrence of data sent to engagement insights capability. If you think of an **event** as a flowing stream of data, an event is that stream at a specific moment.

## Member

A member of a project is a user in the engagement insights capability who can access a project. Members can have roles. Currently, “Owner” is the only role available in engagement insights capability. It allows the user to manage the project and its data, and to view reports.

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Page views and average time spent on site are examples of relevant metrics in engagement insights capability.

## Project

A grouping of data and reports in engagement insights capability. New projects include preconfigured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.

## Refined event

A refined event is a virtual view of a base event. Refined events are used for scoping down a base event for export, or for cleaning up an event containing properties that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Report

A collection of data visualizations. Engagement insights capability includes several predefined reports for web projects.
