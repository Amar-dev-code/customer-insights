# Concepts and common terms

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( ../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear frequently in Product Insights and in its supporting documentation.

## Derived signal

A derived signal is a virtual view of a base signal. Derived signals are used for scoping down a base signal for export, or for cleaning up a signal containing properties that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Event

A single occurrence of data sent to Product Insights. If you think of a **signal** as a flowing stream of data, an event is that stream at a specific moment.

## Member

A member of a project is a user in Product Insights who can access a project. Members can have roles. Currently, “Owner” is the only role available in Product Insights. It allows the user to manage the project and its data, and to view reports.

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Examples of relevant metrics in Product Insights include page views and average time spent on site.

## Project

A grouping of data and reports in Product Insights. New projects include preconfigured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.

## Report

A collection of data visualizations. Product Insights includes several predefined reports for web projects.

## Signal

Data sent to Product Insights from an outside source, such as a website, mobile app, or IoT device. Signals provide a continuous flow of data to get real-time insights how customers use and experience your product.
