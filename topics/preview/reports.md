Select a value in a chart or list to filter the report for the selected value.

## Visitor profile reports

The visitor profile section contains three reports:

- **Browsers** shows a breakdown of the browsers that visitors of your site used to access it.
- **Devices** lists the physical devices that were used to access your site.
- **Operating systems** provides insights into which operating systems the devices run when accessing your site.

- **Real-time usage** shows an overview of current activity on your site, and it auto-refreshes every minute. You can use this to monitor the impact that marketing campaigns, press events, and other scenarios have on your site's traffic.
- **Page views** lists the page views for individual pages along with the number of total page views over the selected time frame.
