[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( ../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Real-time usage** report shows an overview of current activity on your site and it's auto-refreshing every minute. You can use this to monitor the impact that marketing campaigns, press events, and other scenarios that have and impact on your site's traffic.
