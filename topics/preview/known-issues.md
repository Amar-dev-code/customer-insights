# Known issues

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( ../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

As we continue to work on Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability private preview and refine the experience, we have become aware of some outstanding issues for you to keep in mind. These issues are summarized in the following table.

|  | Issue and impact | Workaround | 
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Engagement insights capability is working to change a schema of events by the end of August 2020. | After the new schema is rolled out, you'll need to create a new project, get new code (copied from the snippet), and update it on your site. |
| 2 | The first project you create after you sign in might take up to two minutes to create and it might fail. | Retry a few times. If it takes longer, please contact us at [pirequest@microsoft.com](mailto:pirequest@microsoft.com). |
| 3 | You might experience errors in one tile or real-time usage when data hasn't been sent for some time. | Instrument your website, and send data. After you start sending data again, you should no longer see this error. | 
| 4 | During your quickstart run (after you've signed in as a new user for the first time, accepted terms, and created your project), the code snippet might not contain the ingestion key. | Give it some time and try again later. |
| 5 | We're renaming **signals** to **events**, and **derived signals** to **refined events**, so you might still see all four references in the product. | Please consider these terms as equivalent while we work to complete our updates. |
