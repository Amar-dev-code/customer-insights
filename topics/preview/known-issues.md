# Known issues

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

As we continue to work on the product and refine the experience, we are aware of a few outstanding issues, so bear these in mind as you experience the product. Some of these known issues and workarounds include:

|  | Known issue and impact | Workaround | 
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Product Insights is working on changing a schema of signals by the end of August 2020. | Once the new schema is rolled out, you would need to create a new project, get new code (copied from the snippet), and update it on your site. |
| 2 | Your first project after login may take up to 2 minutes to create and it may fail. | Retry a few times, and if takes longer, please contact us at **pirequest@microsoft.com**. |
| 3 | You may experience error in one tile or real time usage when data has not been sent for some time. | Instrument your web site and send data. Once you start sending data again, you should no longer see this error. | 
| 4 | During your quickstart run (after you have signed in as a new user for the very first time, accepted terms and selected create project), the code snippet may not contain the ingestion key. | Give it some time and try again later. |
| 5 | We are renaming **signals** to **events** and **derived signals** to **refined events**, so you may see may still see all 4 references in the product. | Please consider these terms as equivalent while we work to complete our updates. |
