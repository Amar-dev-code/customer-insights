# Create a dashboard

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dashboards let you organize analyses on a variety of signals that matter to your business or organization. This primarily takes the form of charts.

Once you've created a dashboard, you can share it and collaborate with other individuals in your organization.  

There are two ways to publish to a dashboard:

1. Explore your data through a draft, then promote it to a dashboard chart.
2. Create and publish a chart directly.

Watch the following video to see the dashboard creation and publishing processes.
