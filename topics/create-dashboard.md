# Create a dashboard
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dashboards are a way for you to organize analysis on various signals that are important to your business or organization, primarily in the form of multiple charts. Once you have created a dashboard, you can share it with individuals within your organization or your whole team can collaborate on this dashboard.  

There are two paths to publishing to a dashboard:
1.	You could explore your data through a draft and then promote it to become a dashboard chart. 
2.	You could create a chart directly and then publish to a dashboard.

Watch how to create a dashboard and publish a draft and chart to your dashboard.
