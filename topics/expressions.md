# Analyze data using expressions

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Individual metrics are useful on their own, and they can be even more powerful when related to other metrics.

Expressions in Product Insights allow you to perform arithmetic operations on your data, such as dividing one metric by another over time, and then plot the results. Visualizations containing expressions can be published and viewed in dashboards just like any other chart.
