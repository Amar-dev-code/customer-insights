# Review the data unification steps

Select **Edit** on any of the data unification steps to review and make any changes before creating the unified customer or account profile. When satisifed with your selections, select **Create profiles**.

## Next Step

Configure [activities](activities.md), [enrichment](enrichment-hub.md), or [relationships](relationships.md) to gain more insights about your customers.

If you already configured activities, enrichment, or segments, they'll be processed automatically to use the latest customer data.
