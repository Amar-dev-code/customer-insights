# Review the data unification steps

Select **Edit** on any of the data unification steps to review and make any changes before creating the unified customer or account profile.

If you are satisfied with your selections, select **Create profiles**. Or, select **Save and Close** and run the unification process later.

If you selected **Create profiles**, the **Data** > **Unify** page displays while the unified customer profile is being created. The unification algorithm takes some time to complete and you can't change the configuration until it completes. The results of a successful run displays on the **Unify** page showing the number of matched records.

The unified customer profile entity, called **Customers**, displays on the **Entities** page in the **Profiles** section. The first successful unification run creates the unified *Customer* entity. All subsequent runs expand that entity.
