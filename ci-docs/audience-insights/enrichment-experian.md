# Enrich customer profiles with demographics from Experian (preview)

Experian is a global leader in consumer and business credit reporting and marketing services. With Experianâ€™s data enrichment services, you can build a deeper understanding of your customers by enriching your customer profiles with demographic data such as household size, income, and more.

## Prerequisites

To configure Experian, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You have an active Experian subscription. To get a subscription, [contact Experian](https://www.experian.com/marketing-services/contact) directly. [Learn more about Experian Data Enrichment](https://www.experian.com/marketing-services/microsoft?cmpid=ems_web_mci_cdppage).

- An Experian connection has already been configured by an administrator *or* you have [administrator](permissions.md#administrator) permissions. You also need the User ID, Party ID, and Model Number for your SSH-enabled Secure Transport (ST) account that Experian created for you.

## Supported countries/regions

We currently support enriching customer profiles in the United States only.

This selection will affect the mapping fields you have access to in the next step.

    > More key identifier attributes sent to Experian likely yield a higher match rate.

## Enrichment results

To start the enrichment process, select **Run** from the command bar. You can also let the system run the enrichment automatically as part of a [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). The processing time will depend on the size of your customer data and the enrichment processes set up for your account by Experian.

After the enrichment process completes, you can review the newly enriched customer profiles data under **My enrichments**. Additionally, you'll find the time of the last update and the number of enriched profiles.

You can access a detailed view of each enriched profile by selecting **View enriched data**.

## Next steps

Build on top of your enriched customer data. Create [segments](segments.md), [measures](measures.md), and even [export the data](export-destinations.md) to deliver personalized experiences to your customers.

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Experian, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Experian meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this enrichment at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
