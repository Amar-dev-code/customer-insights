## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). In Mailchimp, you can now find your segments under [Mailchimp audiences](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-audience/).

## Known limitations

- Up to 1 million profiles per export to Mailchimp.
- Exporting to Mailchimp is limited to segments.
- Exporting segments with a total of 1 million profiles can take up to three hours due to limitations on the provider side. 
- The number of profiles that you can export to Mailchimp is dependent and limited on your contract with Mailchimp.

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Mailchimp, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Mailchimp meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
