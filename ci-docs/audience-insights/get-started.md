# Get started with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights audience insights capability

Audience insights helps you build a deeper understanding of your customers. Connect data from various transactional, behavioral, and observational sources to create a 360-degree customer view. Use these insights to drive customer-centric experiences and processes. Unify and understand customer data and harness it for intelligent insights and actions.

## Step 1: Create environment

Before we can get started to set up key components of audience insights, you have to create an environment to work in. If your organization already purchased a license, see [Get started with a paid subscription](get-started-paid.md). To start a trial for audience insights, see [Set up a trial environment](get-started-trial.md). 

## Step 2: Explore audience insights

The first time you sign in to audience insights, you can configure settings and explore the product.

1. [Sign in to audience insights](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com) using your Microsoft Azure Active Directory user account.

1. [Change the environment](manage-environments.md#switch-environments) to see demo data and [explore audience insights](home.md).

##  Step 3: Ingest, unify and relate your data

Unified profiles are at the core of most scenarios to get intelligent insights and take action. Bring in data from various sources and run the data unification process to consolidate it in unified profiles. Specify relationships between the ingested entities use enrichment features to add information to the profiles. 

1. Ingest data by creating data sources based on Power Query connectors, a Common Data Model folder in your own Azure Data Lake Storage, or from Microsoft Dataverse. 

1. Run the data unification process by going through eh map, match, and merge phases.

1. Get familiar with the entities the system creates and create additional relationships between the ingested entities.
	
## Step 4: Enhance unified profiles with predictions, activities, and measures

With unified profiles set up, you can enhance your data and further increase the information they provide.

1. Choose from a growing library of enrichment providers to enrich your customer data.

1. Configure activities based on ingested data and visualize interactions with your customers in a chronological timeline. 

1. Build measures to gauge your business goals and KPIs.
 
## Step 5: Create segments and activate data through various export options

Now that your data is complete and contains a wide range of information about your customers, it's time to look for ways to take action on that data. 

1. Consider creating segments, subsets of your customer base, to ensure your actions are relevant for the targeted customers.

1. Browse a growing catalog of export options where you can use the customer data. For example, to manage promotions or to reach out with digital marketing.

1. Take a look at the integration options, for example, with the direct connection to the engagement insights capability Customer Insights. Or to other Dynamics 365 apps with the Customer Card Add-in.
