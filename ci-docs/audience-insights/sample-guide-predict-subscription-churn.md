# Subscription churn prediction (preview) sample guide

We'll walk you through an end to end example of subscription churn prediction using the sample data provided below. 

## Scenario

Contoso is a company that produces high-quality coffee and coffee machines, which they sell through their Contoso Coffee website. They recently started a subscription business for their customers to get coffee on a regular basis. Their goal is to understand, which subscribed customers might cancel their subscription in the next few months. Knowing which of their customers is **likely to churn**, can help them save marketing efforts by focusing on keeping them.

## Prerequisites

- At least [Contributor permissions](permissions.md) in Customer Insights.
- We recommend that you implement the following steps [in a new environment](manage-environments.md).

## Task 1 - Ingest data

Review the articles [about data ingestion](data-sources.md) and [importing data sources using Power Query connectors](connect-power-query.md) specifically. The following information assumes you familiarized with ingesting data in general. 

### Ingest customer data from eCommerce platform

1. Create a data source named **eCommerce**, choose the import option, and select the **Text/CSV** connector.

1. Enter the URL for eCommerce contacts https://aka.ms/ciadclasscontacts.

1. While editing the data, select **Transform** and then **Use First Row as Headers**.

1. Update the datatype for the columns listed below:

   - **DateOfBirth**: Date
   - **CreatedOn**: Date/Time/Zone

   :::image type="content" source="media/ecommerce-dob-date.PNG" alt-text="Transform date of birth to date.":::

1. In the **Name** field on the right-hand pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **eCommerceContacts**

1. Save the data source.

### Ingest customer data from loyalty schema

1. Create a data source named **LoyaltyScheme**, choose the import option, and select the **Text/CSV** connector.

   - **SubscriptioID**: Whole Number
   - **SubscriptionAmount**: Currency
   - **SubscriptionEndDate**: Date/Time
   - **SubscriptionStartDate**: Date/Time
   - **TransactionDate**: Date/Time
   - **IsRecurring**: True/False
   - **Is_auto_renew**: True/False
   - **RecurringFrequencyInMonths**: Whole Number

1. In the **Name** field on the right-hand pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **SubscriptionHistory**.

1. Save the data source.

### Ingest customer data from website reviews

1. Create a data source named **Website**, choose the import option, and select the **Text/CSV** connector.

1. Enter the URL for eCommerce contacts https://aka.ms/ciadclasswebsite.

1. While editing the data, select **Transform** and then **Use First Row as Headers**.

1. Update the datatype for the columns listed below:

   - **ReviewRating**: Whole Number
   - **ReviewDate**: Date

1. In the 'Name' field on the right-hand pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **webReviews**.

## Task 2 - Data unification

After ingesting the data we now begin the **Map, Match, Merge** process to create a unified customer profile. For more information, see [Data unification](data-unification.md).

### Map

1. After ingesting the data, map contacts from eCommerce and Loyalty data to common data types. Go to **Data** > **Unify** > **Map**.

1. Select the entities that represent the customer profile â€“ **eCommerceContacts** and **loyCustomers**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/unify-ecommerce-loyalty.PNG" alt-text="unify ecommerce and loyalty datasources.":::

1. Select **ContactId** as the primary key for **eCommerceContacts** and **LoyaltyID** as the primary key for **loyCustomers**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/unify-loyaltyid.PNG" alt-text="Unify LoyaltyId as primary key.":::

### Match

1. Go to the **Match** tab and select **Set Order**.

1. In the **Primary** drop-down list, choose **eCommerceContacts : eCommerce** as the primary source and include all records.

1. In the **Entity 2** drop-down list, choose **loyCustomers : LoyaltyScheme** and include all records.

   :::image type="content" source="media/unify-match-order.PNG" alt-text="Unify match eCommerce and Loyalty.":::

1. Select **Create a new rule**

1. Add your first condition using FullName.

   * For eCommerceContacts select **FullName** in the drop-down.
   * For loyCustomers select **FullName** in the drop-down.
   * Select the **Normalize** drop down and choose **Type (Phone, Name, Address, ...)**.
   * Set **Precision Level**: **Basic** and **Value**: **High**.

1. Enter the name **FullName, Email** for the new rule.

   * Add a second condition for email address by selecting **Add Condition**
   * For entity eCommerceContacts, choose **EMail** in drop-down.
   * For entity loyCustomers, choose **EMail** in the drop-down. 
   * Leave Normalize blank. 
   * Set **Precision Level**: **Basic** and **Value**: **High**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/unify-match-rule.PNG" alt-text="Unify match rule for name and email.":::

7. Select **Save** and **Run**.

### Merge

1. Go to the **Merge** tab.

1. On the **ContactId** for **loyCustomers** entity, change the display name to **ContactIdLOYALTY** to differentiate it from the other IDs ingested.

   :::image type="content" source="media/unify-merge-contactid.PNG" alt-text="rename contactid from loyalty id.":::

1. Select **Save** and **Run** to start the Merge Process.


## Task 3 - Configure the subscription churn prediction

With the unified customer profiles in place, we can now run the subscription churn prediction. For detailed steps, see the [Subscription churn prediction (preview)](predict-subscription-churn.md) article. 

1. Go to **Intelligence** > **Discover** and select to use the **Customer churn model**.

1. Select the **Subscription** option and select **Get started**.

1. Name the model **OOB Subscription Churn Prediction** and the output entity **OOBSubscriptionChurnPrediction**.

1. Define two conditions for the churn model:

   * **Days since subscription ended**: **at least 60** days. If a customer doesn't renew the subscription in this period after their subscription ended, they are considered churned. 

   * **Churn definition**: **at least 93** days. The duration the model predict which customers might churn. The further in the future you look, the less precise the results.

     :::image type="content" source="media/model-subs-levers.PNG" alt-text="Select the model levers Prediction Window and Churn Definition.":::

1. Select **Add required data** and select **Add data** for subscription history.

1. Add the **Subscription : SubscriptionHistory** entity and map the fields from eCommerce to the corresponding fields required by the model.

1. Join the **Subscription : SubscriptionHistory** entity with **eCommerceContacts : eCommerce**, name the relationship **eCommerceSubscription**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/model-subscription-join.PNG" alt-text="Join eCommerce entities.":::

1. Under Customer Activities, add the **webReviews : Website** entity and map the fields from webReviews to the corresponding fields required by the model. 
   - Primary key: ReviewId
   - Timestamp: ReviewDate
   - Event: ReviewRating

1. Configure an activity for website reviews. Select the activity **Review** and join the **webReviews : Website** entity with **eCommerceContacts : eCommerce**.

1. Select **Next** to set the model schedule.

   The model needs to train regularly to learn new patterns when there is new data ingested. For this example, select **Monthly**.

1. After reviewing all the details, select **Save and Run**.

## Task 4 - Review model results and explanations

Let the model complete the training and scoring of the data. You can now review the subscription churn model explanations. For more information, see [Review a prediction status and results](predict-subscription-churn.md#review-a-prediction-status-and-results).

## Task 5 - Create a segment of high churn-risk customers

Running the production model creates a new entity that you can see in **Data** > **Entities**.   

You can create a new segment based on the entity created by the model.

1.  Go to **Segments**. Select **New** and choose **Create from** > **Intelligence**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/segment-intelligence.PNG" alt-text="Creating a segment with the model output.":::

1. Select the **OOBSubscriptionChurnPrediction** endpoint and define the segment: 
   - Field: ChurnScore
   - Operator: greater than
   - Value: 0.6
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/segment-setup-subs.PNG" alt-text="Set up subscription churn segment.":::

You now have a segment that is dynamically updated which identifies high churn-risk customers for this subscription business.

For more information, see [Create and manage segments](segments.md).
