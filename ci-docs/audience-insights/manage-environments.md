## Edit an existing environment

You can edit some of the details of existing environments.

1.	Select the **Environment** picker in the header of the app.

2.	Select the **Edit** icon.

3. In the **Edit environment** box, you can update the environment settings.

For more information on environment settings, see [Create a new environment](create-environment.md).

## Copy the environment configuration

When you create a new environment, you can choose to copy the configuration from an existing environment. 

:::image type="content" source="media/environment-settings-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the settings options in the environment settings.":::

You'll see a list of all available environments in your organization where you can copy data from.

The following configuration settings are copied:

- Ingested/imported data sources
- Data unification (Map, Match, Merge) configuration
- Segments
- Measures
- Relationships
- Activities
- Search & filter Index
- Export destinations
- Scheduled refresh
- Enrichments
- Model management
- Role assignments

The following data is *not* copied:

- Customer profiles.
- Data source credentials. You'll have to provide the credentials for every data source and refresh the data sources manually.

- Data sources from the Common Data Model folder and Dataverse-managed data lake. You'll have to create those data sources manually with the same name as in the source environment.

When you copy an environment, you'll see a confirmation message that the new environment has been created. Select **Go to data sources** to see the list of data sources.

All the data sources will show a **Credentials Required** status. Edit the data sources and enter the credentials to refresh them.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-sources-copied.png" alt-text="List of data sources that were copied and need authentication.":::

After refreshing the data sources, go to **Data** > **Unify**. Here you'll find settings from the source environment. Edit them as needed or select **Run** to start the data unification process and create the unified customer entity.

When the data unification is complete, go to **Measures** and **Segments** to refresh them too.
