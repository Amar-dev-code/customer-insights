# Connector for Dynamics 365 Marketing (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Use [segments](segments.md) to generate campaigns and contact specific groups of customers with Dynamics 365 Marketing. For more information, see [Use segments from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights with Dynamics 365 Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/marketing/customer-insights-segments)

## Prerequisite

- Contact records must be present in Dynamics 365 Marketing before you can export a segment from Customer Insights to Marketing. Read more on how to ingest contacts in [Dynamics 365 Marketing using Common Data Services](connect-power-query.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Exporting segments from audience insights to Marketing will not create new contact records in the Marketing instances. The contact records from Marketing must be ingested in audience insights and used as a data source. They also need to be included in the unified Customer entity to map customer IDs to contact IDs before segments can be exported.

## Configure the connector for Marketing

1. In audience insights, go to **Admin** > **Export destinations**.

1. Under **Dynamics 365 Marketing**, select **Set up**.

1. Give your export destination a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Enter your organization's Marketing URL in the **Server address** field.

1. In the **Server admin account** section, select **Sign in** and choose a Dynamics 365 Marketing account.

1. Map a customer ID field to the Dynamics 365 Contact ID.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Choose one or more segments.

1. Select **Save**.

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).
