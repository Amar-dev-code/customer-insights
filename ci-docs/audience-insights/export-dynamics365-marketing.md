# Use segments in Dynamics 365 Marketing (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Use [segments](segments.md) to generate campaigns and contact specific groups of customers with Dynamics 365 Marketing. For more information, see [Use segments from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights with Dynamics 365 Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/marketing/customer-insights-segments)

## Prerequisite for a connection

- Contact records must be present in Dynamics 365 Marketing before you can export a segment from Customer Insights to Marketing. Read more on how to ingest contacts in [Dynamics 365 Marketing using Common Data Services](connect-power-query.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Exporting segments from audience insights to Marketing will not create new contact records in the Marketing instances. The contact records from Marketing must be ingested in audience insights and used as a data source. They also need to be included in the unified Customer entity to map customer IDs to contact IDs before segments can be exported.

## Set up connection to Marketing

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Dynamics 365 Marketing** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connection.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Enter your organization's Marketing URL in the **Server address** field.

1. In the **Server admin account** section, select **Sign in** and choose a Dynamics 365 Marketing account.

1. Map a customer ID field to the Dynamics 365 Contact ID.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection. 

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Dynamics 365 Marketing section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. Choose one or more segments.

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-export-on-demand).
