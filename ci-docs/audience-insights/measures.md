# Define and manage measures

Measures help you to better understand customer behaviors and business performance. They look at relevant values from [unified profiles](data-unification.md). For example, a business wants to see the *total spend per customer* to understand an individual customerâ€™s purchase history or measure *total sales of the company* to understand the aggregate-level revenue in the whole business.  

Measures are created using the measure builder, a data query platform with various operators and simple mapping options. It lets you filter the data, group results, detect [entity relationship paths](relationships.md), and preview the output.

Use the measure builder to plan business activities by querying customer data and extract insights. For example, creating a measure of *total spend per customer* and *total return per customer* helps identify a group of customers with high spend yet high return. You can [create a segment](segments.md) to drive next best actions. 

## Build your own measure from scratch

This section walks you through creating a new measure from scratch. You can build a measure with data attributes from data entities that have a relationship set up to connect with the unified customer profile entity.

# [Individual customers (B2C)](#tab/b2c)

1. In audience insights, go to **Measures**.

1. Select **New** and choose **Build your own**.

1. Select **Edit name** and provide a **Name** for the measure. 

1. In the configuration area, choose the aggregation function from the **Select Function** dropdown menu. Aggregation functions include: 
   - **Sum**
   - **Average**
   - **Count**
   - **Count Unique**
   - **Max**
   - **Min**
   - **First**: takes the first value of the data record
   - **Last**: takes the last value that was added to the data record

1. Select **Add attribute** to select the data you need to create this measure.
   
   1. Select the **Attributes** tab. 
   1. Data entity: Choose the entity that includes the attribute you want to measure. 
   1. Data attribute: Choose the attribute you want to use in the aggregation function to calculate the measure. You can only select one attribute at a time.
   1. You can also select a data attribute from an existing measure by selecting the **Measures** tab. Or, you can search for an entity or measure name. 
   1. Select **Add** to add the selected attribute to the measure.

   :::image type="content" source="media/measure-attribute-selection.png" alt-text="Select an attribute to use in calculations.":::

1. To build more complex measures, you can add more attributes or use math operators on your measure function.

   :::image type="content" source="media/measure-math-operators.png" alt-text="Create a complex measure with math operators.":::

1. To add filters, select the **Filter** in the configuration area. 
  
   1. In the **Add attribute** section of the **Filters** pane, select the attribute you want to use to create filters.
   1. Set the filter operators to define the filter for every selected attribute.
   1. Select **Apply** to add the filters to the measure.

1. To add dimensions, select **Dimension** in the configuration area. Dimensions will show as columns in the measure output entity.
 
   1. Select **Edit dimensions** to add data attributes you want to group the measure values by. For example, city or gender. By default, the *CustomerID* dimension is selected to create *customer-level measures*. You can remove the default dimension if you want to create *business-level measures*.
   1. Select **Done** to add the dimensions to the measure.

1. If there are values in your data that you need to replace with an integer, select **Rules**. Configure the rule and make sure that you choose only whole numbers as replacements. For example, replace *null* with *0*.

1. If there are multiple paths between the data entity you mapped and the *Customer* entity, you have to choose one of the identified [entity relationship paths](relationships.md). Measure results can vary depending on the selected path. 
   
   1. Select **Relationship path** and choose the entity path that should be used to identify your measure. If there's only a single path to the *Customer* entity, this control won't show.
   1. Select **Done** to apply your selection. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/measures-data-preferences.png" alt-text="Select the entity path for the measure.":::

1. To add more calculations for the measure, select **New calculation**. You can only use entities on the same entity path for new calculations. More calculations will show as new columns in the measure output entity.

1. Select **...** on the calculation to **Duplicate**, **Rename**, or **Remove** a calculation from a measure.

1. In the **Preview** area, you'll see the data schema of the measure output entity, including filters and dimensions. The preview reacts dynamically to changes in the configuration.

1. Select **Run** to calculate results for the configured measure. Select **Save and close** if you want to keep the current configuration and run the measure later.

1. Go to **Measures** to see the newly created measure in the list.

## Use a template to build a measure

You can use predefined templates of commonly used measures to create them. Detailed descriptions of the templates and a guided experience help you with efficient measure creation. Templates build on mapped data from the *Unified Activity* entity. So make sure you have configured [customer activities](activities.md) before you create a measure from a template.

# [Individual customers (B2C)](#tab/b2c)

You can use predefined templates of commonly used measures to create them. Detailed descriptions of the templates and a guided experience help you with efficient measure creation. Templates build on mapped data from the *Unified Activity* entity. So make sure you have configured [customer activities](activities.md) before you create a measure from a template.

Available measure templates: 
- Average transaction value (ATV)
- Total transaction value
- Average daily revenue
- Average yearly revenue
- Transaction count
- Loyalty points earned
- Loyalty points redeemed
- Loyalty points balance
- Active customer lifespan
- Loyalty membership duration
- Time since last purchase

The following procedure outlines the steps to build a new measure using a template.

1. In audience insights, go to **Measures**.

1. Select **New** and select **Choose a template**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/measure-use-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dropdown menu when creating a new measure with highlight on template.":::

1. Find the template that fits your need and select **Choose template**.

1. Review the required data and select **Get started** if you have all the data in place.

1. In the **Edit name** pane, set the name for your measure and the output entity. 

1. Select **Done**.

1. In the **Set time period** section, define the time frame of the data to use. Choose if you want the new measure to cover the entire dataset by selecting **All time**, or if you want the measure to focus on a **Specific time period**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/measure-set-time-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the time period section when configuring a measure from a template.":::

1. In the next section, select **Add data** to choose the activities and map the corresponding data from your *Unified Activity* entity.

    1. Step 1 of 2: Under **Activity type**, choose the type of the entity you want to use. For **Activities**, select the entities you want to map.
    1. Step 2 of 2: Choose the attribute from the *Unified Activity* entity for the component required by the formula. For example, for Average transaction value, it's the attribute representing the Transaction value. For **Activity timestamp**, choose the attribute from the Unified Activity entity that represents the date and time of the activity.
   
1. Once the data mapping is successful, you can see the status as **Complete** and the name of the mapped activities and attributes.

   :::image type="content" source="media/measure-template-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a completed measure template configuration.":::

1. You can now select **Run** to calculate the results of the measure. To refine it later, select **Save draft**.

## Manage your measures

You can find the list of measures on the **Measures** page.

You'll find information about the measure type, the creator, creation date, status, and state. When you select a measure from the list, you can preview the output and download a CSV file.

To refresh all of your measures at the same time, select **Refresh all** without selecting a specific measure.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Actions to manage single measures.](media/measure-actions.png "Actions to manage single measures.")

Select a measure from the list for the following options:

- Select the measure name to see its details.
- **Edit** the configuration of the measure.
- **Refresh** the measure based on the latest data.
- **Rename** the measure.
- **Delete** the measure.
- **Activate** or **Deactivate**. Inactive measures won't get refreshed during a [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).

> [!TIP]
> There are [six types of status](system.md#status-types) for tasks/processes. Additionally, most processes [depend on other downstream processes](system.md#refresh-policies). You can select the status of a process to see details on the progress of the entire job. After selecting **See details** for one of the job's tasks, you'll find additional information: processing time, the last processing date, and all errors and warnings associated with the task.

## Next step

You can use existing measures to create [a customer segment](segments.md).
