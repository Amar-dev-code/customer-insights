# Enrichment of customer profiles with enhanced addresses

Addresses in your data can be unstructured, incomplete, or incorrect. Use Microsoft proprietary data and models to normalize and enrich your addresses into the [Common Data Model format](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/address) for better accuracy and insights.

## How we enhance addresses

Our model performs a two-step process to enhance an address. First, it parses the address to identify its components puts them into a structured format. Then, we use our Microsoft proprietary data to correct, complete, and standardize the values in the address.

For example, an address might be in a non-standard format and contain spelling errors. For countries/regions that are supported, we can fix these issues and create a consistent way to list addresses in unified customer profiles.

## Supported countries/regions

We currently support enriching addresses in these countries/regions: 

- Australia
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- United States.

Addresses must contain a country/region value. Addresses that don't contain country/region or contain a country/region thatâ€™s not supported will not be processed.

## Configure the enrichment

1. Go to **Data** > **Enrichment**.

1. Select **Enrich my data** on the **Enhanced addresses** tile and select **Enrich my data**.

1. Select the **Customer data set** and choose the entity containing the addresses you want to enrich. You can select the *Customer* entity to enrich addresses in all your customer profiles or select a segment entity to enrich addresses only in customer profiles contained in that segment.

1. Select how addresses are formatted in your data set. Choose **Single-attribute address** if addresses in your data uses a single field. Choose **Multiple-attribute address** if addresses in your data use more than one data field.

1.	Map the address fields from your unified customer entity. The Country/Region field is mandatory for multiple-attribute addresses.

1. Select **Next** to complete the field mapping.

1. Provide a name for the enrichment

1. Select **Save enrichment** after reviewing your choices.

## Enrichment results

To start the enrichment process, select **Run** from the command bar. You can also let the system run the enrichment automatically as part of a [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). The processing time depends on the size of your customer data.

After the enrichment process completes, you can review the newly enriched customer profiles data under **My enrichments**. Additionally, you'll find the time of the last update and the number of enriched profiles.

You can access a detailed view of each enriched profile by selecting **View enriched data**.

## Next steps

Build on top of your enriched customer data. Create [segments](segments.md), [measures](measures.md), and even [export the data](export-destinations.md) to deliver personalized experiences to your customers.
