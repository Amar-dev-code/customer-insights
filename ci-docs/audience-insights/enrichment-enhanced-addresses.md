# Enrichment of customer profiles with enhanced addresses

Addresses in your data can be unstructured, incomplete, or incorrect. Use Microsoft proprietary data and models to normalize and enrich your addresses into the [Common Data Model format](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/address) for better accuracy and insights.

## How we enhance addresses

Our model performs a two-step process to enhance an address. First, it parses the address to identify its components puts them into a structured format. Then, we use our Microsoft proprietary data to correct, complete, and standardize the values in the address.

For example, an address might be in a non-standard format and contain spelling errors. For countries/regions that are supported, we can fix these issues and create a consistent way to list addresses in unified customer profiles.

## Supported countries/regions

We currently support enriching addresses in these countries/regions: 

- Australia
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- United States.

Addresses must contain a country/region value. Addresses that don't contain country/region or contain a country/region thatâ€™s not supported will not be processed.

## Configure the enrichment

1. Go to **Data** > **Enrichment**.

1. Select **Enrich my data** on the **Enhanced addresses** tile and select **Enrich my data**.

1. Select how addresses are formatted in your data set. Choose **Single-attribute address** if addresses in your data uses a single field. Choose **Multiple-attribute address** if addresses in your data use more than one data field.

1.	Map the address fields from your unified customer entity. The Country/Region field is mandatory for multiple-attribute addresses.

## Data privacy and compliance

Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Leadspace meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
