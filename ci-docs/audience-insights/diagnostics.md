# Export logs to Azure Monitor (Preview)

Dynamics 365 Customer Insights is integrated with Microsoft Azure Monitor. With Azure Monitor resource logs, you can monitor and send logs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) or stream them to [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/).

## Set up the diagnostic settings

### Prerequisites

To configure the diagnostic setup in Customer Insights, the following prerequisites must be met: 

- You have an active [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).
- You have [Administrator](permissions.md#administrator) permissions in Customer Insights.
- You have the **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** role on the destination resource on Azure. The resource can either be an Azure Storage account or Azure Event Hub. For more information, see [Add or remove Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).
- You have at least the **Reader** role on the resource group the resource belongs to.

### Set up diagnostics with Azure Monitor

1. In Customer Insights, select **System** > **Diagnostic** to see the diagnostics destinations configured this instance.

1. Select **Add destination**.

   > ![Diagnostics connection](media/diagnostics-pane.png "Diagnostics connection")

1. Provide a name in the **Name for diagnostics destination** field.

1. Choose the **Tenant** of the Azure subscription with the destination resource and select **Sign in**.

1. Select the **Resource Type** (Storage account or Event hub).

1. Select the **Subscription** containing the destination resource.

1. Select the **Resource group** containing the destination resource.

1. Select the **Resource**.

1. Confirm the **Data privacy and compliance** statement.

- Select **Connect to system** to connect to the destination resource. The logs start to appear in the destination after 15 minutes, assuming the API is in use and generates events.

### Remove a destination

1. Go to **System** > **Diagnostics**. 

1. Select the diagnostics destination in the list.

1. In the **Actions** column, select the trash bin icon.

1. Confirm the deletion to stop the log forwarding. The resource on the Azure subscription won't be deleted. You can select the link in the Actions column to open the Azure portal for the selected resource and delete it there. 


## Log Categories and Schema

Currently [API events](apis.md) are supported and the following categories and schema apply.

### Categories

Customer Insights provides two categories

- `insights-logs-operational` - Events generated using the service, for example `GET` requests.
- `insighgts-logs-audit` -  Events generated by configuration changes on the service, for example `POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH` operations.

### Schema

The log schema is following the [Azure Monitor common schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-schema#top-level-common-schema).
