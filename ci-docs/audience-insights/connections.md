# Connections (preview) overview

Connections are the key to enable data sharing to and from Customer Insights. Each connection establishes data sharing with a specific service. Connections are the foundation to [configure enrichments](enrichment-hub.md) and [configure exports](export-destinations.md). The same connection can be used multiple times. For example, one connection to Dynamics 365 Marketing works for multiple exports.
 
Only administrators can configure new connections but they can grant access to contributors to use exisiting connections. 

Go to **Admin** > **Connections** to create and view connections.

The **Connections** tab shows you all active connections. The list shows a row for each connection. 

Get a quick overview, description, and find out what you can do with each extensibility option on the **Discover** tab.

### Exports
Administrators control where data can go, contributors define the payload and frequency fitting their needs. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

### Enrichments
Administrators manage credentials and give consent to data transfers. The connections can then be used for enrichments by administrators and also by contributors if the administrator has allowed contributors to use the connection during setup. 

## Add a new connection

To add connections, you need to have [administrator permissions](permissions.md). If you connect to other Microsoft services, we assume both services are in the same organization.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections (preview)**.

1. Go to the **Connections** tab.

1. Select **Add connection** to create a new connection. Choose from the drop-down menu what type of connection you want to create.

1. In the **Set up connection** pane provide the required details. 
   1. The **Display name** and the type of the connection describe a connection. We recommend choosing a name which explains the purpose and target of this connection.
   1. The exact fields depend on what service you are connecting to. You can learn about details of a specific connection type in the article about the service.

1. To create the connection select **Save**.

You can also select **Set up** on a tile on the **Discover** tab.

### Allow contributors to use a connection 

When setting up or editing a connection you choose which users are allowed to use this specific connection to define [exports](export-destinations.md) or [enrichments](enrichment-hub.md). By default a connection is available to users with an administrator role. You can change this setting under **Choose who can use this connection** and allow users with contributor role to use this connection.
Connections
- Contributors won't be able to view or edit the connection. They will only see the display name and its type when creating an export.
- By sharing a connection you allow contributors to use a connection. Contributors will see shared connections when they set up exports and enrichments. They can manage every export or enrichment using this specific connection.
- You can change this setting while keeping the enrichments and exports already defined by contributors.

## Edit a connection

1. Select the vertical ellipsis for the connection you want to edit.

1. Select **Edit**.

1. Change the values you want to update and select **Save**.

## Remove a connection

If the connection you are removing is used by enrichments or exports, you first need to disconnect or remove these. The remove dialog will guide you to the relevant enrichments or exports. 
Disconnected enrichments and exports become inactive. You re-activate them by adding another connection to them on the [Enrichments](enrichment-hub.md) or [Exports](export-destinations.md) page.

1. Select the vertical ellipsis for the connection you want to edit.

1. Select **Remove** from the dropdown menu. A confirmation dialog will appear.

   1. If there are enrichments or exports using this connection you will see a corresponding message. Click the button on the message to see the relevant exports in the **Exports** page or enrichments in the **Enrichments** page.
   1. The page will be filtered for the connection you tried to remove. 
   1. **Exports:** You can choose to either remove or disconnect the exports to be able to remove the connection. To disconnect any export, administrators have access to the **Disconnect** action. This action is available for individual and multiple selected exports. By disconnection you keep the export config, but it won't be run until another connection is added to it.
   1. **Enrichments:** You can choose to either remove or deactivate the enrichments to be able to remove the connection. 
   4. Once the connection has no more dependencies you can navigate to **Connections** page and activate **Remove** again.

1. In the dialog window review the list of affected elements. To confirm the deletion select **Remove**.
