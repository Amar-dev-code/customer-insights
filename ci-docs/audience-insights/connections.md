# Connections (preview) overview

Connections are the key to enabling data sharing to or from Customer Insights, including exports. Connections can only be configured by admins, who can also grant access to them for use in certain scenarios by specific roles. 

The **Connections** page shows you all connections you have setup connections for. Additionally, it shows all connections currently available. Get a quick overview, description, and find out what you can do with each extensibility option on the "Discover" pivot. 

Go to **Admin** > **Connections** to find possible connections under **Discover** and see the configured ones under **Connections**.

## Add a new connection
