1. Allow the **ads_management** permission after authenticating with Facebook.

1. Select the **Facebook Ads Account** that you want to work with.

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Facebook Ads Manager, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Facebook Ads meet any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
