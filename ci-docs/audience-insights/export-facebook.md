## Set up connection to Facebook Ads Manager

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** in command bar, choose **Facebook Ads Manager** from drop down menu. This opens the set up form for this connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. Note that this name plus the type of the connection are what describes this connection. We recommend choosing a name which explains the purpose and target of this connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action the default will be **Administrators**. [Learn more about allowing contributors to use a connection](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Authenticate with Facebook Ads: 

   1. Select **Continue with Facebook** to sign in to your Facebook Ad Account.

   1. Allow the **ads_management** permission after authenticating with Facebook.

   1. Select the **Facebook Ads Account** that you want to work with.

   1. Select an **Existing custom audience** from the drop-down list or create a **New custom audience**. For more information, see [**Audiences in Facebook Ads Manager**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/744354708981227?id=2469097953376494).

1. Review the **Data privacy and compliance**. To confirm it, select **I agree**.

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. [Learn about permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export select **Add destination** in command bar. 

1. Open menu for **Connection for export** and pick a connection from section **Facebook Ads Manager**. If you don't see this section name, then there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. In the **Choose your key identifier field**, select **Email**, **Name and address**, or **Phone** to send to Facebook Ads Manager. 

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Map the corresponding attributes from your unified customer entity for the selected key identifier.
   > [TIP]
   > The best chances for a match occur if you select **Email** as key identifier. Adding additional identifiers may improve the matching.

    **FN** = **First Name**, **LN** = **Last Name**, **FI** = **First Initial**, **PHONE** = **Phone**, **GEN** = **Gender**, **DOB** = **Date of birth**, **ST** = **State**, **CT** = **City**, **ZIP** = **Postal code / Zip code**, **COUNTRY** = **Country / Region**

## Data privacy and compliance

Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Facebook Ads meet any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
