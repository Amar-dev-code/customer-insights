# Export segment lists to Omnisend(preview)

## Prerequisites

-	You have an [Omnisend account](https://www.omnisend.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
-	You have [configured segments](segments.md) in audience insights.
-	Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- You can export up to 1 million profiles per export to Omnisend.
- Exporting to Omnisend is limited to segments.
- Exporting up to 1 million profiles to Omnisend can take up to 4 hours to complete. 
- The number of profiles that you can export to Omnisend is dependent and limited on your contract with Omnisend.

## Set up connection to Omnisend

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Omnisend** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Enter your [Omnisend API key](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1061890-generating-api-key).

1. Select **I agree** to confirm the **Data privacy and compliance**.

1. Select **Connect** to initialize the connection to Omnisend.

1. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Customer Insights credentials.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection.

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Omnisend section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.


3. In the **Data matching** section, in the **Email** field, select the field in your unified customer profile that represents a customer's email address. It's required to export segments to Omnisend. Optionally, you can export First name, Last name, Adress, Country/Region, State, City, and Post Code to create more personalized emails. Select **Add attribute** to map these fields.

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand). 


## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Ommisend, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Omnisend meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).

Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
