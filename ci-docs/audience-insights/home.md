# Explore audience insights

You can [access audience insights from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/) on the following URL: [https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/).

The **Home** page shows an overview of segments, measures, and enrichment data (if configured) after completing [data unification](data-unification.md).

1 - Switch between capabilities of Customer Insights 

2 - Use the left pane to navigate between different areas and choose the primary target audience

3 - Find out which environment you work in and manage environments as an administrator

4 - Specify personal settings for Customer Insights

Now you can view the following sections in the home page:

- **Recent segments** shows groups of customers based on demographic, behavioral, or transactional attributes that you've defined. [Creating segments](segments.md) helps you to group your customer base and better target your business activities.

- **Recent measures** shows tiles with [key performance indicators (KPIs)](measures.md) that you've defined. For example, average likelihood of a customer to churn or the average online spend per customer.

- **Recent enrichments** lists results of the enrichment runs that completed recently. [Enrichments](enrichment-hub.md) add information about your customer base. For example, by understanding the interests and brands that they have affinity for.
