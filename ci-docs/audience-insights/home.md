# Explore the home page

You can [access audience insights from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/) on the following URL: [https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/).
The **Home** page shows an overview of segments, measures, and enrichment data (if configured)after completing the [map](map-entities.md), [match](match-entities.md), and [merge](merge-entities.md) phases.

Under **Recent segments**, you see groups of customers based on demographic, behavioral, or transactional attributes that you've defined. [Creating segments](segments.md) helps you to group your customer base and better target your business activities.

**Recent measures** show tiles with [key performance indicators (KPIs)](measures.md) that you've defined. For example, average likelihood of a customer to churn or the average online spend per customer.

The **Recent enrichments** section lists the results of the enrichment runs that completed recently. [Enrichments](enrichment-hub.md) add information about your customer base. For example, by understanding the interests and brands that they have affinity for.

## Switch environments

Select the **Environment** control in the upper-right corner of the page to change environments.

Administrators can create and manage [multiple environments](manage-environments.md). Maintaining more than one environment may be useful if, for example, your organization operates internationally and you need to segregate data and insights in different ways.

## Next step

To see your own insights on the home page, you'll first need to [add data sources](data-sources.md) and [unify](data-unification.md) your data to build customer profiles.
