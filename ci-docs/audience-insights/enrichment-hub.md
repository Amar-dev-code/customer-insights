# Enrichment for customer profiles (preview)

Use data from sources like Microsoft and other partners to enrich your customer data.

:::image type="content" source="media/enrichment-hub-page.png" alt-text="Enrichment hub page":::

In audience insights, go to **Data** > **Enrichment** to work with enrichment options.    
You need to have Contributor or Administrator permissions to create or edit enrichments. For more information, see [Permissions](permissions.md).

On the **Discover** tab, you'll find the following enrichments:

- [Brands](enrichment-microsoft-graph.md) provided by Microsoft Graph
- [Interests](enrichment-microsoft-graph.md) provided by Microsoft Graph
- [Company data](enrichment-leadspace.md) provided by Leadspace
- [Demographics](enrichment-experian.md) provided by Experian
- [Location data](enrichment-here.md) provided by HERE Technologies
- [Custom data](enrichment-SFTP-custom-import.md) through Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

On the **My enrichments** tab, you can see the enrichments you've configured and edit their properties.

## Manage existing enrichments

Go to the **My enrichments** to see all configured enrichments. Each enrichment is represented as a row that includes additional information about the enrichment.

Select an enrichment to see the available options. You can also select the ellipsis (...) on a list item to see the options.

:::image type="content" source="media/enrichment-hub-options-run.png" alt-text="Options to manage enrichments in the list of enrichments":::

- **View** enrichment details with the number of enriched customer profiles.
- **Edit** the enrichment configuration.
- **Run** the enrichment to update customer profiles with the latest data.
- **Deactivate** an existing enrichment to stop it from refreshing automatically with every scheduled refresh. Data from the last successful refresh will continue to be available. **Activate** an inactive enrichment to restart automatic refreshing with every scheduled refresh.
- **Delete** an enrichment.

You can run or deactivate multiple enrichments at once by selecting them in the list. View and edit options aren't available as bulk action and only work for one enrichment at a time.

## Enrichments and connections

Third-party enrichments are configured using [connections](connections.md), which an administrator sets up with credentials and provides consent for data transfers. The connection can be used by administrators and contributors to configure enrichments.  

## Multiple enrichments of the same type

The entity to be enriched is specified during the enrichment configuration, which allows you to enrich only a subset of your profiles. For exmaple, enrich data only for a specific segment. You can configure several enrichments of the same type and reuse the same connection. Some enrichments will have limits to the number of enrichments of the same type that can be created. The limits and current use can be seen on the **Enrichment** page.
