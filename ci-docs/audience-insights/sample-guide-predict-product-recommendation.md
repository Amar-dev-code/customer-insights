# Product recommendation prediction (preview) sample guide

We'll walk you through an end to end example of product recommendation prediction using the sample data provided below.

## Scenario

Contoso is a company that produces high-quality coffee and coffee machines, which they sell through their Contoso Coffee website. Their goal is to understand which products should they recommend to their recurring customers. Knowing what customers are more **likely to purchase**, can help them save marketing efforts by focusing on specific items.

## Prerequisites

- At least [Contributor permissions](permissions.md) in Customer Insights.
- We recommend that you implement the following steps [in a new environment](manage-environments.md).

## Task 1 - Ingest data

Review the articles [about data ingestion](data-sources.md) and [importing data sources using Power Query connectors](connect-power-query.md) specifically. The following information assumes you familiarized with ingesting data in general.

### Ingest customer data from eCommerce platform

1. Create a data source named **eCommerce**, choose the import option, and select the **Text/CSV** connector.

1. Enter the URL for eCommerce contacts https://aka.ms/ciadclasscontacts.

1. While editing the data, select **Transform** and then **Use First Row as Headers**.

1. Update the datatype for the columns listed below:
   - **DateOfBirth**: Date
   - **CreatedOn**: Date/Time/Zone

   :::image type="content" source="media/ecommerce-dob-date.PNG" alt-text="Transform date of birth to date.":::

5. In the 'Name' field on the right-hand pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **eCommerceContacts**

6. **Save** the data source.

### Ingest online purchase data

1. Add another data set to the same **eCommerce** data source. Choose the **Text/CSV** connector again.

1. Enter the URL for **Online Purchases** data https://aka.ms/ciadclassonline.

1. While editing the data, select **Transform** and then **Use First Row as Headers**.

1. Update the datatype for the columns listed below:
   - **PurchasedOn**: Date/Time
   - **TotalPrice**: Currency

1. In the **Name** field on the side pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **eCommercePurchases**.

1. **Save** the data source.


### Ingest customer data from loyalty schema

1. Create a data source named **LoyaltyScheme**, choose the import option, and select the **Text/CSV** connector.

1. Enter the URL for eCommerce contacts https://aka.ms/ciadclasscustomerloyalty.

1. While editing the data, select **Transform** and then **Use First Row as Headers**.

1. Update the datatype for the columns listed below:
   - **DateOfBirth**: Date
   - **RewardsPoints**: Whole Number
   - **CreatedOn**: Date/Time

1. In the **Name** field on the right-hand pane, rename your data source from **Query** to **loyCustomers**.

1. **Save** the data source.

## Task 2 - Data unification

After ingesting the data, we now begin the data unification process to create a unified customer profile. For more information, see [Data unification](data-unification.md).

### Map

1. After ingesting the data, map contacts from eCommerce and Loyalty data to common data types. Go to **Data** > **Unify** > **Map**.

2. Select the entities that represent the customer profile â€“ **eCommerceContacts** and **loyCustomers**.

   ![unify ecommerce and loyalty datasources.](media/unify-ecommerce-loyalty.png)

3. Select **ContactId** as the primary key for **eCommerceContacts** and **LoyaltyID** as the primary key for **loyCustomers**.

   ![Unify LoyaltyId as primary key.](media/unify-loyaltyid.png)

### Match

1. Go to the **Match** tab and select **Set Order**.

2. In the **Primary** dropdown list, choose **eCommerceContacts : eCommerce** as the primary source and include all records.

3. In the **Entity 2** dropdown list, choose **loyCustomers : LoyaltyScheme** and include all records.

   ![Unify match eCommerce and Loyalty.](media/unify-match-order.png)

4. Select **Create a new rule**

5. Add your first condition using FullName.

   - For eCommerceContacts select **FullName** in the dropdown.
   - For loyCustomers select **FullName** in the dropdown.
   - Select the **Normalize** drop down and choose **Type (Phone, Name, Address, ...)**.
   - Set **Precision Level**: **Basic** and **Value**: **High**.

6. Enter the name **FullName, Email** for the new rule.

   - Add a second condition for email address by selecting **Add Condition**
   - For entity eCommerceContacts, choose **EMail** in dropdown.
   - For entity loyCustomers, choose **EMail** in the dropdown.
   - Leave Normalize blank.
   - Set **Precision Level**: **Basic** and **Value**: **High**.

   ![Unify match rule for name and email.](media/unify-match-rule.png)

7. Select **Save** and **Run**.

### Merge

1. Go to the **Merge** tab.

1. On the **ContactId** for **loyCustomers** entity, change the display name to **ContactIdLOYALTY** to differentiate it from the other IDs ingested.

   ![rename contactid from loyalty id.](media/unify-merge-contactid.png)

1. Select **Save** and **Run** to start the Merge Process.

## Task 3 - Configure product recommendation prediction

With the unified customer profiles in place, we can now run the subscription churn prediction.

1. Go to **Intelligence** > **Prediction** choose **Product recommendation**.

1. Select **Get started**.

1. Name the model **OOB Product Recommendation Model Prediction** and the output entity **OOBProductRecommendationModelPrediction**.

1. Define three conditions for the model:

   - **Number of products**: Set this value to **5**. This setting defines how many products you want to recommend to your customers.

   - **Repeat purchases expected**: Select **Yes** to indicate that you want to include products in the recommendation that your customers have purchased before.

   - **Look back window:** Select at least **365 days**. This setting defines how far the model will look back at the customer's activity to use it as input to their recommendations.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/product-recommendation-model-preferences.png" alt-text="Model preferences for the product recommendation model.":::

1. Select **Required data** and select **Add data** for purchase history.

1. Add the **eCommercePurchases : eCommerce** entity and map the fields from eCommerce to the corresponding fields required by the model.

1. Join the **eCommercePurchases : eCommerce** entity with **eCommerceContacts : eCommerce**.

   ![Join eCommerce entities.](media/model-purchase-join.png)

1. Select **Next** to set the model schedule.

   The model needs to train regularly to learn new patterns when there is new data ingested. For this example, select **Monthly**.

1. After reviewing all the details, select **Save and Run**.


## Task 4 - Review model results and explanations

Let the model complete the training and scoring of the data. You can now review the product recommendation model explanations. For more information, see [Review a prediction status and results](predict-subscription-churn.md#review-a-prediction-status-and-results).

## Task 5 - Create a segment of high purchased products

Running the production model creates a new entity that you can see in **Data** > **Entities**.

You can create a new segment based on the entity created by the model.

1. Go to **Segments**. Select **New** and choose **Create from** > **Intelligence**.

   ![Creating a segment with the model output.](media/segment-intelligence.png)

1. Select the **OOBProductRecommendationModelPrediction** endpoint and define the segment:

   - Field: ProductID
   - Operator: Value
   - Value: Select the top three product IDs

   :::image type="content" source="media/product-recommendation-quick-segment.png" alt-text="Create a segment from the model results.":::

You now have a segment that is dynamically updated which identifies the customers who are more willing to purchase the three most recommended products 

For more information, see [Create and manage segments](segments.md).
