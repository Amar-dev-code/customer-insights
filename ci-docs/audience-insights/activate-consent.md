# Activate consent rules

[Consent Center (preview)](../consent-management/overview.md) helps you to harmonize consent data from various sources. Use the unified *Consent* entity to apply default consent checks. After importing consent data in Consent Center and configuring the rules for the imported consent data, the *Consent* entity is automatically synced to audience insights.

## Enable consent checks

With consent data imported to Consent Center (preview) and rules set up, you can enable consent checks in audience insights. 

:::image type="content" source="../consent-management/media/enable-consent-checks-audience-insights.png" alt-text="Consent tab in audience insights settings with activated consent data.":::

1. In audience insights, go to **Admin** > **System**.

1. Select the **Consent (preview)** tab.

1. In the **Enable consent checks** section, set the toggle for the area you want to enable to **On**.

1. Select the **Allow override of default consent rules** checkbox to remove the default consent checks enforced on a particular segment. In the dropdown menu, select where you want to allow overrides on.     

1. In the **Link consent to customer profiles** section, choose the attribute that is used as an identifier to link consent data to customer data. It's likely a phone number or an email address. 

1. Select **Save** to apply your settings.

## Disable consent checks

To stop using consent data in audience insights, an admin has to update the system settings accordingly.

1. In audience insights, go to **Admin** > **System**.

1. Select the **Consent (preview)** tab.

1. In the **Enable consent checks** section and set the toggle to **Off**.
