# Export segments to Autopilot (preview)

Export segments of unified customer profiles to Autopilot and use them for email marketing in Autopilot. 

## Prerequisites for a connection

-	You have an [Autopilot account](https://www.autopilothq.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
-	You have [configured segments](segments.md) in audience insights.
-	Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- You can export up to 100'000 profiles in total to Autopilot.
- Exporting to Autopilot is limited to segments.
- Exporting up to 100'000 profiles to Autopilot can take up to a few hours to complete. 
- The number of profiles that you can export to Autopilot is dependent and limited on your contract with Autopilot.

## Set up connection to Autopilot

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Autopilot** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

3. Enter your [Autopilot API key](https://autopilot.docs.apiary.io/#).

1. Select **I agree** to confirm the **Data privacy and compliance**.

1. Select **Connect** to initialize the connection to Autopilot.

1. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Customer Insights credentials.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection.

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Autopilot section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

3. In the **Data matching** section, in the **Email** field, select the field in your unified customer profile that represents a customer's email address. Repeat the same steps for other optional fields such as **First name**, **Last name**.

1. Select the segments you want to export. We strongly **recommend to not export more than 100'000 customer profiles in total** to Autopilot. 

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand). 

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Autopilot, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Autopilot meet any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
