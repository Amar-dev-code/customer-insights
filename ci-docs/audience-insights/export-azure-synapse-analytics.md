# Overview

You can now use your Customer Insights data within [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is).

# Prerequisites

To configure the connection from Customer Insights to Azure Synapse Analytics and to use your Customer Insights data within Azure Synapse Analytics, the following prerequisites must be met:

  > [!NOTE]
  > Using Customer Insights data in Azure Synapse Analytics is only working if the following prerequisites, in particular the role assignments, are respected.  

## Prerequisites in Customer Insights

* You have an Administrator role in Audience Insights. Learn more about [setting user permissions in audience insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/audience-insights/permissions#assign-roles-and-permissions)

## Prerequisites in Azure 
* You have an active Azure Subscription
 
* If using a new Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account, the service principal for Audience Insights and the user needs to be assigned **Storage Blob Contributor** permissions. Learn more on [how to connect to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account with an Azure service principal for audience insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/audience-insights/connect-service-principal)

* On Synapse workspace, the service principal for Audience Insights needs to be assigned **Reader** permissions. Learn more on [How to set up access control for your Synapse workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-set-up-access-control) 

* On Synapse workspace api, the first party app needs **Admin** role assigned. Learn more on [How to set up access control for your Synapse workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/security/how-to-set-up-access-control) 

# Set up the connection to Azure Synapse Analytics from within Customer Insights

## Configure a connection
1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Azure Synapse Analytics** or click the **Set up** on the **Azure Synapse Analytics** tile to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the Display name field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Select or search for the subscription you want the Customer Insights data use in. As soon as a subscription is selected, you can also select Workspace, Storage account and Container. 

1. Select **Save** to save the connection. 

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add export**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the **Azure Synapse Analytics** section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. Provide a recognizable **Display name** for your export and a **Database name**. 

1. Select which entities you want to export to Azure Synapse Analytics. 

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand).
