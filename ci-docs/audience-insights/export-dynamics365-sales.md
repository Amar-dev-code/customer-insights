# Use segments in Dynamics 365 Sales (preview)



Use your customer data to create marketing lists, follow up workflows, and send out promotions with Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Known limitations

- Exports to Dynamics 365 Sales are limited to 100'000 members per segment.
- Segment exports to Dynamics 365 Sales can take up to 3 hours to complete. 

## Prerequisite for connection

1. Contact records must be present in Dynamics 365 Sales before you can export a segment from Customer Insights to Sales. Read more on how to ingest contacts from [Dynamics 365 Sales using Microsoft Dataverse](connect-dataverse-managed-lake.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Exporting segments from Customer Insights to Sales will not create new contact records in the Sales instances. The contact records from Sales must be ingested in Customer Insights and used as a data source. They also need to be included in the unified Customer entity to map customer IDs to contact IDs before segments can be exported.

## Set up the connection to Sales

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Dynamics 365 Sales** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Enter your organization's Sales URL in the **Server address** field.

1. In the **Server admin account** section, select **Sign in** and choose a Dynamics 365 Sales account.

1. Map a customer ID field to the Dynamics 365 Contact ID.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection. 

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Dynamics 365 Sales section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. Choose one or more segments.

1. Select **Save**

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand).
