# Connect to data from the Customer Insights data library

The Customer Insights data library contains a collection of sample data sets that can be ingested into your tenant for testing, exploration, and analysis. The sample data sets represent different industries and provide a safe, functional, and powerful experience that new users can use to freely explore the capabilities that Customer Insights offers without needing to secure and ingest real business data.

## Connect to the Customer Insights data library

1. In audience insights, go to **Data** > **Data sources**.

1. Select **Add data source**.

1. Select **Customer Insights data library**.

1. Choose your sample data set and optionally provide a description.

   > [!NOTE]
   > <p>The Name field is fixed and cannot be changed.
   > The Description field is populated with a default description of the data set which can be overwritten with a new description if desired.</p>
