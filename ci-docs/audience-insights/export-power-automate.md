# Power Automate connector (preview)

Trigger specific events to occur automatically when your data changes and manage more complex flows directly in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

## Known limitations
- You can do a maximum of 100 calls per 60 seconds. You can call the API endpoint multiple times by using the $skip parameter [Read more about the $skip parameter.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/customerinsights/#get-items-from-an-entity)

## Power Automate triggers

Use triggers to create cloud flows and automate repetitive tasks, such as notifications or more advanced actions. 

- Trigger when a data source refresh fails. 
- Trigger when a data source refresh succeeds.
- Trigger when a threshold is crossed on a segment. The trigger is limited to crossing above the threshold.
- Trigger when a threshold is crossed on a business measure. Only business measures without a dimension are supported. The trigger is limited to crossing above the threshold.
- Trigger when a full refresh of (data sources, segments, measures, ...) is completed.
- Trigger when a refresh of the unification process (map, match, merge) is completed.

## Power Automate actions

The Power Automate connector provides other actions than the available triggers. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Connector](/connectors/customerinsights/).

## Create a Power Automate flow

1. In audience insights, go to **Admin** > **Export destinations**.

1. On the **Power Automate** tile, select **Set up**.

1. The Customer Insights Connector (preview) in Power Automate opens. **Sign in** to Power Automate.

1. Choose one of the available triggers and add more steps to your new flow. For more information, see [Create a cloud flow in Power Automate](/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow).

Examples of how to use flows: 
- Post a message to a Microsoft Teams channel if a data source refresh fails. 
- Send an email to the data owners when a threshold on a segment is crossed.
