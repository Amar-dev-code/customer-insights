## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).

## Known limitations

- You can export up to 250'000 profiles in per export to AdRoll.
- You cannot export segments with less than 100 profiles to AdRoll. 
- Exporting to AdRoll is limited to segments.
- Exporting up to 250'000 profiles to Adroll can take up to 10 minutes to complete. 
- The number of profiles that you can export to AdRoll is dependent and limited on your contract with AdRoll.

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Autopilot, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Autopilot meet any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
