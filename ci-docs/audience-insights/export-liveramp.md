## Export the data

The export will start shortly if all prerequisites for export have been completed. The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).
Once the export is successfully completed, you can sign in to LiveRamp Onboarding to activate and distribute your data.

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Liveramp, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Liveramp meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
