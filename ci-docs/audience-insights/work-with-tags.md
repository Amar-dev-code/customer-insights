# Work with tags

A tag is a label that’s used to categorize a Customer Insights component such as a segment. Use tags to organize components. For example, add a tag to segments that are part of a specific campaign. Then, you can filter by that tag to identify the segments for the campaign quickly and easily.

Segments is used in the following examples.

## Manage tags

You can view, add, and remove tags from a component. Add tags as you create a component. After creation, manage tags from the list view of the component.

1. Go to the list view. For example, go to **Segments**.

1. Select the segment whose tags you want to manage.

1. Select the vertical ellipsis (…) and select **Tag**.

   - To add an existing tag to the segment, type a portion of the name in the **Tags** box until you see the tag you want. Select the tag.
   - To create a tag, type the name in the **Tags** box. If the tag name does not already exist, select **New tag**. The new tag is added to the segment.
   - To remove a tag, select **X** next to the tag name.
