# Organize list views

Organize lists using tags and columns to find data quickly and easily and view the data the way you want.

Tags and columns are currently supported with **Segments** for individual customers. Segments are used in the following examples.

## Manage tags

A tag is a label that’s used to categorize and organize items such as segments. For example, add a tag to segments that are part of a specific campaign. Then, you can filter by that tag to identify the segments for the campaign quickly and easily.

You can view, add, and remove tags from an item. Add tags as you create an item. After creation, manage tags from the list view.

1. Go to the list view. For example, go to **Segments**.

1. Select the segment whose tags you want to manage.

1. Select the vertical ellipsis (…) and select **Tag**.

1. From the **Edit tags** pane, choose any of the following:

   - To add an existing tag to the segment, type a portion of the name in the **Tags** box until you see the tag you want. Select the tag.
   - To create a tag, type the name in the **Tags** box and press **Enter**. The new tag is added to the segment.
   - To remove a tag, select **X** next to the tag name.

1. Select **Apply**.

## Filter on tags

Use tags to filter your list of items.

1. Go to the list view. For example, go to **Segments**.

1. Select **Filter**.

1. Search and select the tags you want to filter by.

1. Select **Apply**. Only records that match the filter tags display.

## Customize columns

Customize columns to arrange your list of items. You can add or remove columns and change the order of the columns.

1. Go to the list view. For example, go to **Segments**.
