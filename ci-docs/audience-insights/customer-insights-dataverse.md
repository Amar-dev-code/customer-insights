# Work with Customer Insights data in Microsoft Dataverse

Customer Insights provides the option to make output entities available in [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro.md). This integration enables easy data sharing and custom development through a low code / no code approach. The output entities will be available as tables in Dataverse. These tables enable scenarios like [automated workflows through Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/) and [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/) through Power Apps. You can use the data for any other application that is based on Dataverse tables. The current implementation mainly supports lookups where data from the available audience insights entities can be fetched for a given customer ID.

## Attach a Dataverse environment to Customer Insights

**Organizations with existing Dataverse environments**

Organizations that already use Dataverse can choose to [use one of their existing Dataverse environments](manage-environments.md#create-an-environment-in-an-existing-organization) when creating the audience insights environment. By providing the URL to the Dataverse environment, it's attaching to their new audience insights environment. To ensure the best possible performance, Customer Insights and Dataverse environments must be hosted in the same region.

To attach a Dataverse environment, expand the **Advanced settings** when creating the audience insights environment. Provide the **Microsoft Dataverse environment URL** and select the checkbox to **Enable data sharing**.

**New organization**

If a new organization is created when signing up for Customer Insights, it will automatically get a new Dataverse environment during the provisioning process.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organizations already uses Dataverse in their tenant, itâ€™s important to remember that [Dataverse environment creation is controlled by an admin](/power-platform/admin/control-environment-creation.md). For example, if a you're setting up a new audience insights environment with your organizational account and the admin has disabled the creation of Dataverse trial environments for everyone except admins, you can't create a new trial environment.
> 
> The Dataverse trial environments created in Customer Insights have 3 GB of storage which won't count towards the overall capacity entitled to the tenant. Paid subscriptions get Dataverse entitlement of 15 GB for database and 20 GB for file storage.

## Output entities

Some output entities from audience insights are available as tables in Dataverse. The sections below describe the expected schema of these tables.

- [CustomerProfile](#customerprofile)
- [AlternateKey](#alternatekey)
- [UnifiedActivity](#unifiedactivity)
- [CustomerMeasure](#customermeasure)
- [Enrichment](#enrichment)
- [Prediction](#prediction)


### CustomerProfile

This table contains the unified customer profile from Customer Insights. The schema for a unified customer profile can vary based on the entities that are ingested, unified, and attributes that are used in the merge process. A typical customer profile schema contains a subset of the attributes from the [Common Data Model definition of CustomerProfile](/common-data-model/schema/core/applicationcommon/foundationcommon/crmcommon/solutions/customerinsights/customerprofile).

### AlternateKey

The AlternateKey table contains keys of the entities, which participated in the unify process.

|Column  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|DataSourceName    |String         | Name of the data source. For example: `datasource5`        |
|EntityName        | String        | Name of the entity in audience insights. For example: `contact1`        |
|AlternateValue    |String         |Alternative ID that is mapped to the customer ID. Example: `cntid_1078`         |
|KeyRing           | Multiline text        | JSON value  </br> Sample: [{"dataSourceName":" testdatasource ",</br>"entityName":" contact1",</br>"preferredKey":" cntid_1078",</br>"keys":[" cntid_1078"]}]       |
|CustomerId         | String        | ID of the unified customer profile.         |
|AlternateKeyId     | GUID         |  AlternateKey deterministic GUID based on msdynci_identifier       |
