# Enrichment for data sources (preview)

Use data from sources like Microsoft and other partners to enrich your customer data.To produce higher quality unified customer profiles, enrich a data source before data unification. You can enrich partial data to try out a subscription before purchasing it or enrich specific profiles by selecting a market or segment.

The enrichment is not run after it is configured but is automatically run as part of the data source's scheduled refresh.

Data source enrichment options include Enhanced addresses.

## Enrich a data source

1. In audience insights, go to **Data** > **Data sources**.
1. Select the vertical ellipsis next to the data source you want to enrich and select **Enrich**.
1. Configure the enrichment. For more information, see [Enhanced addresses](enrichment-enhanced-addresses.md).

 > [!NOTE]
 > When naming the enrichment, the output entity name is automatically populated.
