# Enrichment for data sources (preview)

Use data from sources like Microsoft and other partners to enrich your customer data. To produce higher quality unified customer profiles, enrich a data source before data unification. You can enrich partial data to try out a subscription before purchasing it or enrich specific profiles by selecting a market or segment.

Data source enrichment options include Enhanced addresses.

## Enrich a data source

You need to have Contributor or Administrator permissions to create or edit enrichments. For more information, see [Permissions](permissions.md).

1. In audience insights, go to **Data** > **Data sources**.
1. Select the vertical ellipsis next to the data source you want to enrich and select **Enrich**.

## Manage existing data source enrichments

Go to the **My enrichments** tab to see all configured enrichments.

Select the enrichment to see the available options. You can also select the ellipsis (...) on a list item to see the options. If you configured several enrichments, you can use the search box to find it quickly.

You can view, edit, run, or delete a data source enrichment. For more information, see [Manage existing enrichments](enrichment-hub.md).
