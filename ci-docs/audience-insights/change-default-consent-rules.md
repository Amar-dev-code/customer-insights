# Disable or change default consent rules

If your organizations uses the [consent management capability](../consent-management/overview.md) combined with audience insights, [admins can enforce consent](activate-consent.md) for segments. 

With enforced consent rules in the segment area, every segment informs about the state of consent check and rules. If overrides are allowed, default consent rules are turned off for specific segments. Every creator of a segment can add more consent rules for a segment.
