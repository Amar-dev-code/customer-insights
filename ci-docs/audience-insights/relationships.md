# Relationships between entities

Relationships help you connect entities and generate a graph of your data when entities share a common identifier (foreign key) that can be referenced from one entity to another. Connected entities enable the definition of segments and measures based on multiple data sources.

There are three types of relationships: 
- Non-editable system relationships, created by the system as part of the data unification process
- Non-editable inherited relationship, which are created automatically from ingesting data sources 
- Editable custom relationships, created and configured by users

## Non-editable system relationships

During the match and merge processes, system relationships are created behind the scenes based on intelligent matching. These relationships help relate the customer profile records with other corresponding entities' records. The following diagram illustrates the creation of three system-based relationships when the customer entity is matched with additional entities to produce the unified *Customer* entity.

:::image type="content" source="media/relationships-entities-merge.png" alt-text="Diagram with relationship paths for the customers entity with three 1-n relationships.":::

- ***CustomerToContact* relationship** was created between the *Customer* entity and the *Contact* entity. The *Customer* entity gets the key field **Contact_contactID** to relate to the *Contact* entity key field **contactID**.
- ***CustomerToAccount* relationship** was created between the *Customer* entity and the *Account* entity. The *Customer* entity gets the key field **Account_accountID** to relate to the *Account* entity key field **accountID**.
- ***CustomerToWebAccount* relationship** was created between the *Customer* entity and the *WebAccount* entity. The *Customer* entity gets the key field **WebAccount_webaccountID** to relate to the *WebAccount* entity key field **webaccountID**.

## Non-editable inherited relationships

During the ingestion process, a check is done on the data sources to see if relationships already exist, if they do then they are created behind the scenes so that users do not have to recreate them. They can also be used in downstream processes.

The next section will outline how to create custom relationships.

## Custom relationships

Each relationship consists of a *source entity* containing the foreign key and a *target entity* that the source entity's foreign key points to. Relationships are defined and managed on the **Relationships** page. 

### Create a custom relationship

1. In audience insights, go to **Data** > **Relationships**.

2. Select **New relationship**.

3. In the **New relationship** pane, provide the following information:

   :::image type="content" source="media/relationship-add.png" alt-text="New relationship side pane with empty input fields.":::

   - **Relationship name**: Name that reflects the purpose of the relationship. Example: CustomerToSupportCase.
   - **Description**: Description of the relationship.
   - **Source entity**: Entity that is used as a source in the relationship. Example: SupportCase.
   - **Target entity**: Entity that is used as a target in the relationship. Example: Customer.
   - **Source cardinality**: Specify the cardinality of the source entity. Cardinality describes the number of possible elements in a set. It always relates to the target cardinality. You can choose between **One** and **Many**. Only many-to-one and one-to-one relationships are supported.  
     - Many-to-one: Multiple source records can relate to one target record. Example: Multiple support cases from a single customer.
     - One-to-one: A single source record relates to a one target record. Example: One loyalty ID for a single customer.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Many-to-many relationships can be created using two many-to-one relationships and a linking entity, which connects the source entity and the target entity.

   - **Target cardinality**: Select the cardinality of the target entity records. 
   - **Source key field**: The foreign key field in the source entity. Example: SupportCase could use CaseID as a foreign key field.
   - **Target key field**: The key field of the target entity. Example Customer could use the **CustomerID** key field.

4. Select **Save** to create the custom relationship.

## View relationships

The Relationships page, presents a view of all the relationships that have been set up. Each relationship is represented by a row which also includes details about the source, the entity and the cardinality. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![View relationships](media/Relationship3.png "View relationships")


The following actions are available from this page
1.**New Relationship**: described earlier
2.	**Visualizer**: selecting this will show a visual view of how the relationships are set up including cardinality. The boxes can be dragged around the screen or organize the view. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Visualizer](media/Relationship4.png "Visualizer")

â€¢	The following actions are available from this view
o	**Export as image**: selecting this allows you to export the view as an image
o	**Change to horizontal**: selecting this will change the view
o	**Edit**: If this is user created custom relationship then clicking on the edit circle will highlight the primary and foreign keys and present the edit panel from which edits can be made and saved updating the visual too

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Edit](media/Relationship5.png "Edit")

3.	**Filter by**: selecting this will provide the user with options to see some, many or all of the relationships

## Manage existing relationships 
On the Relationships page, you can view all your saved relationships, and manage them. Each relationship is represented by a row which also includes details about the source, the entity and the cardinality. 
The following actions are available 

1.	**Edit**: This is available for user created custom relationship and will open a side panel where you can change the details of the relationship 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Edit_existing](media/Relationship6.png "Edit existing")

2.	**Delete**: This is available for user created custom relationship and this will open a pop to reconfirm you would like to delete the relationship. You can also choose to delete more than one activity at once, by selecting all the activities and clicking the delete icon. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Delete](media/Relationship7.png "Delete")

3.	**View**: This is available for system and inherited relationships and will open a side panel where you can change the details of the relationship 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![View](media/Relationship8.png "View")


## Next step

System and custom relationships are used to create segments based on multiple data sources that are no longer siloed. For more information, see [Segments](segments.md).
