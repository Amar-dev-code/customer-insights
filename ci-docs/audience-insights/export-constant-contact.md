## Set up connection to Constant Contact

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **Constant Contact** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Select **I agree** to confirm the **Data privacy and compliance**.

1. Select **Connect** to initialize the connection to Constant Contact.

1. Select **Authenticate with Constant Contact** and provide your admin credentials for Constant Contact. 

1. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Customer Insights credentials.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection.

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the Constant Contact section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. Enter your [**Constant Contact List ID**](https://app.constantcontact.com/pages/contacts/ui#lists). Open a list in Constant Contact to find the list ID in the URL.

1. In the **Data matching** section, in the **Email** field, select the field that represents a customer's email address. It's required to export segments to Constant Contact.

1. Optionally, you can export First name and Last name as additional fields to create more personalized emails. Select **Add attribute** to map these fields.

1. Select the segments you want to export.

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand). 


## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to Constant Contact, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that Constant Contact meets any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).

Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
