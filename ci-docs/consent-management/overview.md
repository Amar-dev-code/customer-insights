[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Modern marketing efforts collect data in various forms to provide unique experiences for new and existing customers. To create truly personalized experiences, organizations rely on customer data gathered through first- and third-party sources. 

Privacy regulations and important evolutions around the control of customer data require organizations to constantly adapt their marketing scenarios. As shown in the video below, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights helps you build customer trust on a consent-enabled customer data platform (CDP).

As an organization that runs on trust, Microsoft empowers its customers to do the same. We provide organizations with tools to honor trust with their own customers by helping them stay compliant with regulatory requirements. 

The consent management capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights helps organizations manage the usage of customer consent. It builds a unified set of consent data from the various outlets an organization uses to connect with their customers. 

Integrating the unified consent data with other capabilities such as audience insights can help organizations respect privacy commitments. Consent and contact preferences are automatically available in business processes within audience insights.
