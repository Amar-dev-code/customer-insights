# Add and remove users

Consent management, a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights is available on a subscription basis. All users in an organization that owns consent management can get access to the service. 

Currently, all administrators of audience insights have access to the consent management capability. You can't add users in the Consent Center directly.

Administrators add and remove other users and assign them the required permissions. Refer to the documentation about [user permissions](../audience-insights/permissions.md) in audience insights for details about managing users and user roles.
