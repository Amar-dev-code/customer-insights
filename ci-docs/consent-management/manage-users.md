# How to add users to consent management

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The [consent management capability](overview.md) is available on a subscription basis. All users in an organization that owns consent management can get access to the service. 

Currently, all administrators of Customer Insights have access to the consent management capability. They can add and remove other users and assign them the required permissions in Customer Insights. Admins can't add users to the Consent Center directly. 

Review the documentation about [user permissions](../permissions.md) in Customer Insights to manage users and user roles.
