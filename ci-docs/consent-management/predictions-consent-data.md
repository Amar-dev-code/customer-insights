# Use consent data in prediction models

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can build out-of-box prediction models in audience insights to predict customer churn or customer lifetime value. Use consent data from the [consent management capability](overview.md) to increase the accuracy of these predictions.

The steps below detail how to use consent data in out-of-box models, with the focus on the transactional churn model. However, you can apply these same steps to the subscription churn and customer lifetime value models. 

## Required entities and fields

The following list outlines the entities that are required and the fields these entities must contain. For more information, go to [Prerequisites for a transaction model](../predict-transactional-churn.md).

1. *Subscription consent* entity
    - **Primary key or ID:** A primary key for each unique consent value. It requires unique values in each row, for example, email or customer ID. 
    - **Customer ID:** A customer identifier that links the consent entity to the customer entity and their transaction data. This identifier should be the same across all required entities. 
    - **Consent start date:** The date that consent was updated. This field can also include time.
    - **Consent status:** A consent value that indicates which customers consented.
    
2.	*Customer transaction* entity
    - **Transaction ID:** A primary key for each transaction.
    - **Customer ID:** A customer identifier that links the consent entity to the customer entity and their transaction data. This identifier should be the same across all required entities. 
    - **Transaction date:** Date of each transaction.
    - **Value of transaction:** Amount of each transaction.
    - **Label assigned to returns** (optional): Boolean value that indicates if the transaction is a return.
    - **Unique product ID** (optional): ID that represents the product or service of the transaction. 

3.	*Customer* entity with a primary key representing each unique customer. This identifier should be the same across all required entities. 

## Setup instructions

The steps below outline how to use consent data as activity data input to the transactional churn model. You must create an activity based on consent data, set up the model as usual, and add the consent activity as a customer activity in the model configuration.

### Step 1: Create a consent activity

[Create an activity](../activities.md) based on your consent entity: 

1. Start the guided experience to create an activity.
1. In the **Relationships** step, select the *Customer ID* of the *Consent* entity as the foreign key.
1. Choose the *Customer* entity to map to.
1. Select the *Customer ID* in the *Customer* entity as the primary key.
1. In the **Activity unification** step, select **Consent status** under the **Event activity** field. 
1. Select the field that describes when consent was provided in the **Timestamp** field.

1. In the **Activity type** step, select **Create new** in the dropdown for **Activity Type**.
1. Enter a name for your consent activity.

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-consent-activity-type.png" alt-text="Create a new activity type for consent data.":::

1. Review and run the consent activity. Continue to the next step after a successful run. For more information about activities, go to [Customer activities](../activities.md).

### Step 2: Configure and run the model 

Follow these instructions to [create a transactional model](../predict-transactional-churn.md) until you configure the additional data:

1. In the **Additional data (optional)** step of the model creation, select **Add data**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/additional-data-choose-activity.png" alt-text="Choose consent activity in add data step.":::

1. Choose the consent activity created in the previous step and choose the corresponding *Consent* entity.
1. Select **ActualActivityId** as the primary key.
1. Select **StartTime** as the timestamp.
1. Select **ActivityName** as the activity event.

   :::image type="content" source="media/additional-data-map-attributes.png" alt-text="Map attributes when adding the consent activity.":::

1. Select **Save** and then **Next**. 
1. Choose how frequently the data will be updated and the model will be run. Then, select **Next**.
1. Review and confirm your settings and select **Run**.  

## View and interpret model results

View the model results to gain insights.

- **Training model performance:** Indicates the performance of the prediction based on how many customers it predicted accurately. Adding consent data and other optional data helps increase the likelihood of precise predictions. 
- **Likelihood to churn (number of customers):** Provides groups of customers based on their predicted risk of churn. 
- **Most influential factors:** Lists the factors that affect the model results. Find out what type of influence the consent data had by looking at the **Activity** factors. Another way to gauge the influence of consent data is to set up a model without consent data and compare the results to this model.
