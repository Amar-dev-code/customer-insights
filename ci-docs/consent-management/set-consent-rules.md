# Set consent data rules and apply consent preferences

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Define how customer data is used based on a customer's consent preferences. You can choose to include or exclude customer data from business activities that involve usage of customer data. For example, you can exclude customers from your product announcements if they haven't given consent for marketing emails.

## Start the consent rules process

First, [import consent data](import-consent-data.md) before your configure consent rules. 

Once consent data is in the system, go to the **Consent** page in the Consent Center and select **Set rules**.

## Set up rules

Consent data rules will be available in audience insights where you can apply them as rules to individual segments or exports. You can assign these rules to purposes and subscriptions as default rules that automatically apply to all segments. The app guides you through the steps to complete to map the consent data. 

1. Go to **Consent** and select **Set rules** to start the **Map consent data** process.

### Set rules

The first step defines if customers should be included or excluded based on their content preferences. Every imported data source with consent data must be part of a rule mapping. For example, you have imported two consent data sources for product offers and company news. Your rule mapping could have two rule mappings. One includes contacts that opted-in to the product offers. The other excludes contacts that opted-out from company news.

1. In the **Set rules** step, create the first rule.
   :::image type="content" source="media/set-up-rules-step.png" alt-text="Set up rules step with available options."::: 
    1. Under **Select actions**, specify if you want to **Include** or **Exclude** contacts. 
    1. Under **Select data**, choose the purposes or subscriptions to apply the logic to. 
    1. Under **Select value(s)**, select the values to complete the rule.

1. Optionally, select **Add another mapping** to define more rules.

1. Select **Next**.

### Apply rules as default (optional)

In this step, you choose which purposes and subscriptions will have the rule mappings applied to all segments in audience insights. Rules for the imported consent data are automatically synced to audience insights. Administrators have to [activate the consent rules](../audience-insights/activate-consent.md) and can allow users to override the default selection.

1. In the **Apply rules as default (optional)** step, choose which purposes and subscriptions to apply the rule to. These rules are then applied to segments in audience insights.

1. Select **Next**.

### Review and finish

1. Review the configuration and select **Set rules** to complete the process. 

1. Select **Done** go complete the guided experience and enforce the mapping in business processes.

## Activate rules in audience insights

Before the rules are applied to business processes through audience insights, an admin has to activate them. For more information, see [Activate consent rules](../audience-insights/activate-consent.md).
