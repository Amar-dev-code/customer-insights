## Change the language

During public preview, the app is only available in English and French. More languages are added when the capability is generally available. 

To change the language, [update your language settings in Customer Insights](../system.md#update-the-settings).

## Stop using the consent management capability

After an admin has provisioned the consent management capability, it's automatically available in the linked Customer Insights environment. Currently, you can't remove consent management from your environment once it's provisioned. 

However, there are some workarounds that an admin can use to stop enforcing consent rules and hence disable the functionality related to consent management. 

1. In audience insights, go to System > Consent (preview). 

1. Select the checkbox to allow overrides.

1. In the **Enable consent checks** section, set the toggle to **Off**.
