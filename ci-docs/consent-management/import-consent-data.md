# Import consent data

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Consent management lets you import data about the consent agreements from your customers. There are two types of consent data: subscriptions and purposes. Subscriptions are channels of communication to existing or prospective customers. Purposes indicate how data can be used and processed.

## How to import consent data

After setting up the consent management capability, the first-run experience guides you to start of the data import process. You can also start the process by going to **Home** or **Consent** in the left pane of the consent center. The steps to import consent data are the same, wherever you start the process.

1. In Consent Center, go to **Consent**.

1. Select the **Import consent data** control and choose which consent type to import. You can choose between **Purpose** and **Subscription**. Depending on the selected type, the [requirements for consent data](#data-requirements-for-consent-data) are different.

1. The final step to import a data source is the **Refresh settings** step where you tell the system when to look for updates on the data source. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/refresh-settings.PNG" alt-text="Set the refresh settings of the data source.":::
    Choose if you want to **Refresh manually** if the data source changed, or if you prefer the system to do the **Refresh automatically**. For automated refresh, set your preference for when a refresh should happen.

1. Select **Save** to start the data import. 

1. Depending on the size if the imported data set, it can take a moment to complete the import process
