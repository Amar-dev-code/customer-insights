# Get started with consent management

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The consent management capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights enables organizations to manage consent data.

## Step 1: Set up consent management

You have to be an [administrator in audience insights](../audience-insights/permissions.md) to work with the consent management capability.

Select **Go to Consent Center** from the **Home** page of audience insights. It might take a moment to get the Consent Center ready if it's the first time you visit. Review the terms of service before you continue. You'll start on the home page of the Consent Center. This page gives an overview of the key features and provides links to related documentation.

## Step 2: Import consent data

In the Consent Center, [import the consent data](import-consent-data.md) your organization collected through a broad set of available connectors.

## Step 3: Configure consent data rules and define default rules

After successfully importing consent data, [configure consent data rules](set-consent-rules.md) and define rules to apply by default.

## Step 4: Apply consent rules to segments in audience insights

The rules you created automatically sync with audience insights. [Activate default consent rules](../audience-insights/activate-consent.md) for segments in audience insights. You can now [export segments](../audience-insights/export-destinations.md) in audience insights with applied consent data rules.
