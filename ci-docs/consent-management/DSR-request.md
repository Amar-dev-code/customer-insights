# GDPR  - To do 

Smith to share content that is vetted with CELA. 

Should cover how admins in Verity can respond to a DSR of a user who gave consent. Inform user about the consent dat a they have about them and how to delete it, if necessary. Likely similar to AUI flow, where deletion must happen on data source. The deleted records will be removed with the next refresh of consent data and subsequently in AUI (and other integrations) too.
