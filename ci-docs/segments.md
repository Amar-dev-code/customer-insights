# Segments overview

Segments let you group your customers based on demographic, transactional, or behavioral attributes. You can use segments to target promotional campaigns, sales activities, and customer support actions to achieve your business goals.

Customer profiles that match the filters of a segment definition are referred as *members* of a segment. Some [service limits](/dynamics365/customer-insights/service-limits) apply.

## Create a new segment

There are multiple ways to create a new segment: 

# [Individual consumers (B-to-C)](#tab/b2c)

- Complex segment with segment builder: [Build our own](segment-builder.md#create-a-new-segment) 
- Simple segments with one operator: [Quick segment](segment-builder.md#quick-segments) 
- AI-powered way to find similar customers: [Similar Customers](find-similar-customer-segments.md) 
- AI-powered suggestions based on measures or attributes: [Suggested segments to improve measures](suggested-segments.md) 
- Suggestions based on activities: [Suggested segments based on customer activity](suggested-segments-activity.md) 

# [Business accounts (B-to-B)](#tab/b2b)

- Complex segment with segment builder: [Build our own](segment-builder.md#create-a-new-segment)

## Manage existing segments

Go to the **Segments** page to view all your saved segments and manage them.

Each segment is represented by a row that includes additional information about the segment.

:::image type="content" source="media/segments-selected-segment.png" alt-text="Selected segment with options dropdown list and available options." lightbox="media/segments-selected-segment.png":::

The following actions are available when you select a segment:

- **View** the segment details, including member count trend a preview of segment members.
- **Download** the list of members as a .CSV file.
- **Edit** the segment to change its properties.
- **Create duplicate** of a segment. You can choose to edit its properties right away or save the duplicate.
- **Refresh** the segment to include the latest data.
- **Activate** or **Deactivate** the segment. For inactive segments, the segment definition exists but it doesn't contain any customers yet. An active segment looks for customers that match the segment definition. If a [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab) is configured, inactive segments have the **Status** listed as **Skipped**, indicating that a refresh wasn't even attempted. When an inactive segment is activated, it will refresh and will be included in scheduled refreshes.
  Alternatively, you can use the **Schedule later** functionality in the **Activate/Deactivate** dropdown to specify a future date and time for activation and deactivation of a particular segment.
- **[Find similar customers](find-similar-customer-segments.md)** from the segment.
- **Rename** the segment.
- **Tag** to [manage tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#manage-tags) for the segment.
- **Download** the list of members as a .CSV file.
- **Manage exports** to see exports related segment and manage them. [Learn more about exports.](export-destinations.md)
- **Delete** the segment. See [Delete segments](#delete-segments) about how deletion affects the usage of a segment.
- **Columns** to [customize the columns](work-with-tags-columns.md#customize-columns) that display.
- **Filter** to [filter on tags](work-with-tags-columns.md#filter-on-tags).
- **Search name** to search by segment name.

## Refresh segments

You can refresh all segments at once by selecting **Refresh all** on the **Segments** page or you can refresh one or multiple segments when you select them and choose **Refresh** in from the options. Alternatively, you can configure a recurring refresh on **Admin** > **System** > **Schedule**. When a recurring refresh is configured, the following rules apply:

- All segments with the type **Dynamic** or **Expansion** will be automatically refreshed at the set cadence. Once the refresh is complete the **Status** indicates if there were any issues in refreshing the segment. The **Last refreshed** shows a timestamp of the last successful refresh. If an error occurs, select the error to see details about what happened.
- Segments with the type **Static** *won't* be refreshed automatically. The **Last refreshed** shows a timestamp of the last time the static segments was run or refreshed manually.

## Export segments

You can export a segment from the segments page or the [exports page](export-destinations.md). 

1. Go to the **Segments** page.

1. Select **Show more [...]** for the segment you want to export.

1. Select **Manage exports** from the actions dropdown list.

1. The page **Exports (preview) for segment** opens. You can see all configured exports grouped by whether they contain the current segment or not.

   1. To add the selected segment to an export, **Edit** the respective export to select the corresponding segment, then save. In environments for individual customers, you can instead select the export in the list and select **Add segment** to achieve the same outcome.

   1. To create a new export with the selected segment, select **Add export**. For more information about creating exports, see [Set up a new export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Select **Back** to return to the main page for segments.

## Track usage of a segment

If you export segments to apps that are based on the same Microsoft Dataverse organization that is connected with Customer Insights, you can track the usage of a segment. For [Customer Insights segments used in customer journeys of Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-ci-profile), the system informs you about the usage of that segment.

When editing a segment that is being used within the Customer Insights environment, or in a customer journey in Marketing, a banner in the [segment builder](segment-builder.md) informs you about the dependencies. You can inspect the dependency details directly from the banner or by selecting **Usage** in the segment builder.

The **Segment usage** pane shows the details about the usage of this segment within your Customer Insights environment and in Dataverse-based apps. For segments used in customer journeys, youâ€™ll find a link to inspect the journey in Marketing where this segment is used. If you have permissions to access the Marketing app, you can access more details there.

## Delete segments

Generally, if a segment is [exported to other services](export-destinations.md), Customer Insights updates the segment according to the refresh schedule. Until you delete a segment or stop the export, the most recent segment members are exported regularly. Deleting a segment will stop the export of that segment and usually, the last refreshed version of the segment remains in the export destination service.

If you export segments to apps that are based on the Microsoft Dataverse organization that is connected with Customer Insights, it's possible to track the usage of a segment. For our prime example, [Customer Insights segments used in customer journeys of Dynamics 365 Marketing](/dynamics365/marketing/real-time-marketing-ci-profile), the system informs you about the usage of a segment when you try to delete it. If the segment you're about to delete is used in a customer journey in Marketing, that journey will stop for all users in the segment. If the journey is part of a marketing campaign, the deletion will affect that campaign itself. However, you can still delete the segment despite the warnings.

## View processing history and segment members

You can see consolidated data about a segment by reviewing its details.

On the **Segments** page, select the segment you want to review.

The upper part of the page includes a trend graph that visualizes changes in member count. Hover over data points to see the member count on a specific date.

You can update the time frame of the visualization.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Segment time range.](media/segment-time-range.png "Segment time range")

The lower part contains a list of the segment members.

> [!NOTE]
> Fields that appear in this list are based on the attributes of your segment's entities.
>
>The list is a preview of the matching segment members and shows the first 100 records of your segment so that you can quickly evaluate it and review its definitions if needed. To see all matching records, you need to [export the segment](export-destinations.md).
