# Service limits in Customer Insights capabilities

This article describes the built-in limits to the Customer Insights service, which are designed to ensure the reliability and stability of the service. Any requests for changes can be made through the [Ideas forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074172). 

## Audience insights

### Service limits in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights audience insights capability

| Area  | Limits  | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Segments and measures | 100 segments or measures. | The total number of active [segments](audience-insights/segments.md) and [measures](audience-insights/measures.md) combined can't exceed 100.  |
| Relationships | 20 levels of depth on relationships in entity paths. | When creating [segments](audience-insights/segments.md) or [measures](audience-insights/measures.md) using the builder interface, entity paths can have up to 20 relationship hops between the start entity and the target entity.  |


## Engagement insights

### Workspace and event quotas

Engagement insights is a highly scalable application that can support millions of events per second. During public preview, events have a volume threshold. There's also a limit to the number of workspaces in an organization.

### Engagement insights limits

- Maximum event volume per workspace  = 100 events per second

- Maximum number of workspaces per organization = 100

When events exceed the threshold, it can lead to loss of data in reports based on those events. You can [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2145734) to request a volume increase before you exceed limits. We'll work with you to determine your need for a volume increase and support your request.
