A report is a collection of data visualizations. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights comes with a set of out-of-the-box reports, using the data collected through the SDK. You can access them from the **Reports** page. The reports are grouped into four categories:

- **[Key metrics](#key-metrics-reports)**
- **[Content](#content-reports)**
- **[Traffic sources](#traffic-sources-reports)**
- **[Visitor profiles](#visitor-profiles-reports)**

- To select a time frame, select **...** from the drop-down list of the report. Time range selection is disabled for a real-time usage report; the time range for a real-time usage report is “now.”

- In most reports, select a value in a chart or list to filter the report for the selected value.

## Key metrics reports

- **Real-time usage** provides an overview of current activity on your site that automatically refreshes every minute. Use real-time usage to monitor the impact of marketing campaigns, press events, and other scenarios on your site's traffic.

- **Visits** shows information about the number of visits and the visit duration.
- **Visitors** informs about new and returning unique visitors to your site.

## Content reports

- **Links** show information about the number and type of clicks that were performed.
- **Exit pages** lists the links that visitors clicked to exit your site.

## Traffic sources reports

- **Referrers** lists the domains and URLs that referred visitors to your site.
- **Tracking codes** provides details about the tracking codes in the links that brought visitors to your site.

## Visitor profiles reports

- **Devices** lists the physical devices that were used to access your site.
- **OS & browsers** provide insights into the operating systems and browsers that were running when accessing your site.
