# About Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[Engagement insights, a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/engagement-insights-capability/) enables you to understand, using interactive metrics, how your customers are using your services and products. You can do this both individually and holistically, on websites, mobile apps, and connected products.

With engagement insights, you can combine behavioral analytics with transactional, demographic, survey, and other data types from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. This capability creates rich insights that help drive next best actions and personalized experiences.

## Features and benefits

With the engagement insights capability, you can:

- Collect, measure, and understand customer behavior on your website.

- Share data between engagement insights and audience insights. You can link environments from both capabilities, and enables data to be shared bidirectionally between them.

- Use unified profiles and segments from audience insights for more analysis options in engagement insights. Export events that have a high-business value from engagement insights. Use these events to add data to unified profiles in audience insights.

- Create demographic dimensions for splitting behavioral data. Then use profile properties in interactive analyses of behavioral data, including data captured by engagement insights on your website or mobile app.

- Create funnel insights, which provide data and reports to inform decisions and identify areas for optimization and process improvements, to identify paths that your customers take before they make a purchase. 

-  Use out-of-box reports to  access site metrics interactively and reveal the true number of visitors to your website. Find out details about visits, page views, referral traffic, and identify pages with the best performance.

- Use the custom report builder to create your own visualizations based on selected [metrics](glossary.md) and [dimensions](glossary.md). These visualizations create the views you need to answer your business questions.

- Bring in data from multiple channels. For example, use behavioral data from website interactions with transactional and demographic data about your customers. Use the data to build and view interactive reports that include web activities and customer profiles for rich analytics. Create and export refined events. View web activities with customer profiles, activities, and segments in Customer Insights for a 360-degree view of your customers.
