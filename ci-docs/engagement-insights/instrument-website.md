# Install the code snippet on a website

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article describes how an administrator installs the code snippet on a website. You'll start seeing events in your workspace shortly after adding the script to your website. For more information, see [Manage workspaces and environment](manage-environments-workspaces.md).


### Prerequisites

* You must have administrator permissions for the workspace to store the data.
* Your website or project must be hosted online to send activity data. Data sent from a local file will not be accepted by the server.


## Add code to your website
1.	Go to **Admin** > **Workspace**  and then select **Installation guide**.
1. Select **Copy code** to copy the code snippet. By default, the ingestion key for your workspace is embedded in the code snippet.

3. Add the copied code snippet to your website, near the <head> tag and before any other script or CSS tags.
4.	Publish your updated website and wait a few minutes to capture the incoming web traffic.
5.	To see your data, select your workspace from the workspace drop-down list in the navigation pane. Then, go to one of the reports in the Discover section.

## Configuration options

You can change the following configuration options in the code snippet:

- **ingestionKey**: The ingestion key used to send events to your workspace. You can change the ingestion key to send events to a different
- **autoCapture**: Specifies if page views and interactions with the website are captured. It has two options:
    - **view**: Set to *true* to capture page views. Page views are captured as *View* [events](glossary.md#event), a type of [base event](glossary.md#base-event). [Single page applications](#considerations-for-single-page-applications-spas) need to instrument views manually and must instrument the trackView() API whenever they route to a new page.
    - **click**: Set to *true* to capture visitor interactions on the website. Interactions are captured as *Action* [events](glossary.md#event), a type of [base event](glossary.md#base-event).

## Considerations for Single Page Applications (SPAs)

The script can't automatically collect view events for SPAs. Set `autoCapture` to *false* or remove the autoCapture option from the code snippet. You can manually instrument view events instead with the `trackView(view)` API that can be used to log a page view. The only required field in the *view* object is the `uri`.

The following example shows a code snippet tracking a view event. The "NAME" is the value in the `name` key in the code snippet configuration. It's also the variable name in the window object where the SDK is loaded.

```

window["NAME"].trackView({
  uri: "https://mywebsite.com/path/"
});

```
