# Run the Android SDK sample

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This sample Android project helps you understand how the SDK works in an app. You donâ€™t have to write code. Just add your ingestion key and you can see events in your workspace right away.

## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Ingestion key](get-started-android.md)

## Download the Android SDK sample

1. [Download the engagement insights Android SDK sample](https://download.pi.dynamics.com/sdk/EI-SDKs/ei-android-sample.zip).
1. Unzip the compressed file `ei-android-sample.zip`.
1. Open the unzipped folder in Android Studio.
1. In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, replace the string `"Your-Ingestion-Key"` with your workspace ingestion key from engagement insights under **Admin** > **Workspace** > **Installation guide**. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > You don't need to replace the `${applicationId}` section. It is automatically populated.

   ```xml
   <application>
   ...
       <provider
           android:authorities="${applicationId}.com.microsoft.engagementinsights.eiandroidsdk.AnalyticsContentProvider"
           android:name="microsoft.dynamics.engagementinsights.eiandroidsdk.AnalyticsContentProvider" />
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.ingestionKey"
           android:value="Your-Ingestion-Key" />
       <meta-data
           android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.autoCapture"
           android:value="true" />
   ...
   </application>
   ```

1. Select **Run** to start the sample project.
