# Get started with the Android SDK

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This tutorial guides you through the process of instrumenting your Android application with a Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights SDK. You'll start seeing signals in your portal in five minutes or sooner.

## Configuration options
The following configuration options can be passed to the SDK:

- **ingestionKey**: The ingestion key used to send signals to your workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio

- Minimum Android API Level: 16 (Jelly Bean)

- An ingestion key (see below for instructions on how to obtain)

## Step 1. Integrate the SDK into your application
The process begins by selecting a workspace and downloading the Android SDK.

- Use the workspace switcher in the left navigation pane to select your workspace.

 - If you don't have an existing workspace, select  **New Workspace** and follow the steps to create a [new workspace](create-workspace.md).

## Step 2. Configure the SDK

1. After you create a workspace, go to **Admin** > **Workspace** and then selection  **Installation guide**. 

<Brittany, per your note, I deleted the ingestion key information. Does the user copy code or just download the SDK here?> 

2. Download the [engagement insights Android SDK](https://download.pi.dynamics.com/sdk/EI-SDKs/ei-android-sdk.zip), and place the `eiandroidsdk-debug.aar` file in the `libs` folder.

1. Open your project level `build.gradle` file and add the following snippets:
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation(name: 'eiandroidsdk-debug', ext: 'aar')
        api 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.1'
    }

    repositories {
        flatDir {
            dirs 'libs'
        }
    }
    ```

1. Set up the engagement insights SDK configuration through your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located under the `manifests` folder. Add the following lines under your `<application>` tag and replace `Your-Ingestion-Key` with the key created from Step 2:

<Brittany, remove "replace `Your-Ingestion-Key` with the key created from Step 2" above?>

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to replace the `${applicationId}` part as it is automatically populated.
   

    ```xml
    <application
    ...
        <provider
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.com.microsoft.engagementinsights.AnalyticsContentProvider"
            android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.AnalyticsContentProvider" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.ingestionKey"
            android:value="Your-Ingestion-Key" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.autoCapture"
            android:value="true" />
    ...
    </application>
    ```

4. Enable or disable autocapture of `View` events by setting the above `autoCapture` field to `true` or `false`.

1. (Optional) Other configurations include setting the endpoint collector URL. They can be added under the ingestion key metadata in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
    ```xml
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.microsoft.engagementinsights.endpointUrl"
            android:value="https://some-endpoint-url.com" />
    ```


## Step 3. Initialize the SDK from your MainActivity
    
    Java:
    ```java
    Analytics analytics = new Analytics();
    ```

    Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    var analytics = Analytics()
    ```

### Set property for all events (optional)
    
    Java:
    ```java
    analytics.setProperty("year", 2021);
    ```

    Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    analytics.setProperty("year", 2021)
    ```

    The following types are supported for context event properties:
    * String
    * Date
    * Double
    * Long
    * Boolean
    * UUID

### Track an event

    Java:
    ```java
    Event event = new Event("video");
    event.setProperty("duration", 320);
    event.setProperty("ad_shown", true);
    analytics.trackEvent(event);
    ```

    Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    var event = Event("video")
    event.setProperty("duration", 320)
    event.setProperty("ad_shown", true)
    analytics.trackEvent(event)
    ```

## Set user details for your event

The SDK lets you define user information that can be sent with every event. You can specify user information by calling `setUser(user: User)` API on the `Analytics` level.

    Java:
    ```java
    User user = new User();
    user.setName("testuser");
    user.setEmail("testuser@mail.com");
    analytics.setUser(user);
    ```

    Kotlin:
    ```kotiln
    var user = User();
    user.name = "testuser"
    user.email = "abc@xyz.com"
    analytics.setUser(user)
    ```

The `User` data class contains the following string properties:

- **localId**: The user's local ID.
- **authId**: The authenticated user ID.
- **authType**: The authentication type used to the get authenticated user ID.
- **name**: The user's name.
- **email**: The user's email address.
