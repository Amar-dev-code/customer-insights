# First run experience

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Engagement insights, a capability of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, lets you collect and measure customer behavior on your website. This article explains how to sign up for engagement insights, set up a workspace, add members to it, and make changes.

## Sign up for a demo of engagement insights

You must have an active Microsoft Azure Active Directory user account. 

1. Open the [engagement insights](https://pi.dynamics.com/) website. 

1. Sign in with your school or work account.

1. Select your region, and use the check box to indicate whether you want to opt in to receive updates and offers via email.

1. Review the **engagement insights (preview) Terms of Use** and **Privacy Statement**, and then select **Explore the demo** to accept them.

1. Explore the product using a set of sample data. 

## Set up your first workspace in engagement insights

A workspace is how you store and manage events and reports.

To create your first workspace

2. Choose the type of activity that you want to measure in a new workspace. Currently, only **Website activity** is available. **App activity** and **Device activity** will become available in future releases.

1. Select **Next** to confirm and create the workspace.

1. Add a code snippet to your website to start receiving data in engagement insights. You can implement this right away or share the code and instructions with your website admin. To find the code snippet later, go to **Admin** > **Workspace** > **Installation guide**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Data will not show in the workspace until the code has been implemented on your website.

1. Select **Done** to open your new workspace. 

## Add members to an existing workspace

By default, only the person who created the workspace has access to it. You can add other users from your organization to an existing workspace at any time.

4. Select **Add members** to confirm.

To remove members from a workspace, select **...** next to their names on the **Members** page and then select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
