[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

1. Review the **engagement insights (preview) Terms of Use** and **Privacy Statement**, and then select **Explore the demo** to accept them.
1. Welcome to the demo. This is where you can explore the product using a sample set of data.

You must add a code snippet to your website to start receiving data in engagement insights. You can implement this right away or share the code and instructions with your webmaster. To find the code again, go to **Admin**>**Data**> **Code**.
