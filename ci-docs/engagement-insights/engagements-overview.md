# Introducing Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability 

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Engagement insights capability collects data for web, mobile apps and connected devices so you can understand your customer.  Use the data to personal campaigns and engagement to retain and gain customers. 

- Use the engagement insights capability to surface, measure, and understand customer behavior on your website, in your mobile apps, and across your connected products.
	
- Provides you with real-time visibility into your connected physical product and digital experiences by collecting signals and acquiring a live stream of data for real-time analysis. As a result, you can monitor and learn from customer interactions in the moment, and proactively deliver more personalized and responsive end-to-end customer experiences.  (future capability?)

- Rich metrics: Aggregate signals (counts, averages, percentiles), filter and split by dimension (e.g., model or country), smooth and clean data, compute expressions, and perform comparisons (existing capability?)

- Leverages the AI and machine-learning components of Azure AI with the customer data platform (CDP) elements of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to help you better engage with your customers and transform your product development, sales, and support.
