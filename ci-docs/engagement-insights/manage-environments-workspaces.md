# Manage environments and workspaces

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Overview

This topic discusses how to manage workspaces and environments once they've already been created. 

- A *workspace* is a space to store and manage events and reports. Itâ€™s where you can view user activity in real time. When you create a workspace, you select the type of data to send to the workspace. Currently, web data and mobile apps are supported. For more information, see [Create a new workspace and add members](create-workspace.md).

- An *environment* is a space where you manage your workspaces and connections. For more information, see [Create a new environment](create-new-environment.md).

## Manage an existing workspace

You can maintain multiple workspaces concurrently in an environment. Your [role](user-roles.md) determines how you can work in them. 

 - You must be an environment admin or a workspace admin to manage the workspace.
 - As a workspace admin, you can rename existing workspaces or delete them.
