# Manage environments and workspaces

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Overview

A workspace is a space to store and manage events and reports. Itâ€™s where you can view user activity in real time. When you create a workspace, you select the type of data to send to the workspace. Currently, only web data is supported.

An environment is a space where you manage your workspaces and connections. How you use environments depends on your organization and your use case.
For example, you can create:

-	A single environment.
-	Separate environments for test and production.
-	Separate environments for specific teams or departments in your organization that contain relevant events for each audience.
-	Separate environments for different global branches of your company.
-	Connections to Customer Insights audience insights capability.

## Choose an environment and create a workspace 

 Every workspace needs to be in an environment. You can select a pre-existing environment or make a new one when you create a workspace. Then you can choose to add workspace members and start collecting data.

To create your first workspace

1. In engagement insights, select **New** from the workspace switcher.

1. Enter a name in **Workspace name**. 

1. You can add members and assign their permission level from the **Role** list. Then select **Finish** to create the workspace or **Next** to install code. 

1. Install the code snippet to start receiving data and then select **Done**. 

## Manage a workspace

You can maintain multiple workspaces concurrently in an environment. Your  [role](user-roles.md)  determines how you can work in them. 

 - As a Workspace admin, you can rename existing workspaces or delete them. 
 - You must be an Environment admin or a Workspace admin to manage the workspace.

### Edit a workspace name

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workspace** and select **Settings**.

1. In the **Workspace name** box, enter a new name.

1. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

### Delete a workspace

Deleting a workspace will permanently remove all of its content, data, settings, and permissions. It can't be undone.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workspace** and select **Settings**.

1. Select **Delete Workspace**. 

1. In the **Delete workspace** dialog, enter **CONFIRM DELETE**. 

1. Select **Delete** to permanently delete the workspace.

### Manage workspace members

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workspace** and select **Members**.

1. Select **Add members** to give access and [assign roles](user-roles.md). Currently, only **Workspace admin** is available.

1. If you set up a [connection to audience insights](configure-connections.md), you can select **Allow access to profile data** to allow the member to see reports based on [user profiles](profile-reports.md).

1. Select **Add members** to add them to your workspace.

## Manage an environment

As an Environment admin, you can access an environment from the left navigation pane. You can configure environment settings, other Environment admins, workspaces, and [connections to audience insights](configure-connections.md). Select tabs to move between different areas in the admin center.

## Manage connections

Establishing connections to audience insights lets you see reports in engagement insights based on unified customer profiles.

To protect your customer's personal data, you can delete or export end-user identifiable data.

For more information, see [Delete and export event data containing personal information](delete-export-personal-data.md).
