# Cross-channel funnel reports 

A funnel report collects information about the steps that occur during a customer journey through your website. Engagement insights now offers the ability to collect behavioural customer data on your mobile app. 
Once you have instrumented your mobile app with the Engagement insights Android or iOS SDK, you can create cross-channel funnel reports. 

## Create a cross-channel funnel report 

Follow the steps for creating a [funnel report](funnel-reports.md). 
To track how your customers are interacting with your brand across both your website and mobile app, or multiple websites, use the **Workspace Switcher** to create funnel steps with data from other workspaces. 

1. In the **Funnel Editor**, under **Steps** select which workspace the data for your funnel step should come from.
