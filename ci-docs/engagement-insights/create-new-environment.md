# Create a new environment 

## Overview

An environment is a space where you manage your workspaces and connections. How you use environments depends on your organization and your use case. For example, you can create:

- A single environment.
- Separate environments for test and production.
- Separate environments for specific teams or departments in your organization that contain relevant events for each audience.
- Separate environments for different global branches of your company.
- Connections to Customer Insights audience insights capability.
