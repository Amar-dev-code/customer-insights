# Recognize web events from previously authenticated visitors

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **unknown to known** feature in the engagement insights capability enables associating events on a website with visitors who authenticated previously. If the feature is disabled, visitors who authenticated during an earlier visit and then left are not identified if they donâ€™t authenticate again when coming back. 

For example, a person visited a website last week, signed into their user account on the site, and browsed the product catalog. The person returns the following week to browse more products without signing into their account. The site owner using the **unknown to known** feature would know that the same person had returned and what they had done on the site. This allows for more precise reporting and analysis of website activities.

## Enable unknown to known

You need to be a [workspace admin](user-roles.md) to enable this feature. 

1. In engagement insights, go to **Admin > Workspace**. 
2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. In the **Unknown to known** section, set the toggle to **Enabled**.

## Data flow

1. Visitor signs in via special mapping event `(CookieId and AuthId)` which is sent to engagement insights and passed on to Azure Storage.
2. Web events get ingested to engagement insights.
3. Unauthenticated (unknown) web events are passed on to Azure Storage.
4. Events get combined and enriched with AuthId for visitors who authenticated. These eventy are now known.
5. Enriched events are stored in [Kusto](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/concepts) moving forward.

## Adding JavaScript code to your site's tracking snippet

A website can capture **user authId** with the following JavaScript sample using the [engagement insights web SDK](advanced-SDK-implementation.md).

```
},
userMapping: true
},
user:{
authId: getLoggedInUserId()*,
email: getLoggedInUserEmail()*,
authType: "MSA",
name: "John Doe"
}
```
