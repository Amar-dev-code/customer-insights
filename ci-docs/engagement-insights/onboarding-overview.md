# Onboard to the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability private preview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This onboarding article describes Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability private preview product features, documentation, scenarios to validate, and known issues. It explains how to engage with Microsoft throughout the private preview. Nothing in this documentation is meant &mdash; or should be construed &mdash;to modify the terms of your agreements with Microsoft, including your preview terms.

## Onboarding overview

1.	Review and agree to the [nondisclosure and preview agreement](preview-terms-of-service.md) with Microsoft.  
2.	Review [capabilities outlined in this article](#private-preview-capabilities) for private preview.  
3.	Review and understand [expectations](#private-preview-expectations) described in the following section, and [known issues](known-issues.md) of the private preview.  
4.	Validate the [core scenarios](#product-use-cases-to-test) and provide feedback to Microsoft.

## Private preview expectations

*	Private preview is for testing purposes only. Environments might be taken down at the end of the testing period to make way for future releases. See the [Preview terms of service](preview-terms-of-service.md) for more disclosures and limitations.  
*	Private preview isn't for production use, but is strictly for prototyping and providing feedback. We're likely to delete data and rebuild environments at any point during the private preview, but we'll make reasonable effort to ensure that we communicate any changes to avoid disruption in testing.   
*	We'll work closely with you to seek feedback and incorporate product changes. We expect to establish a cadence for this interaction during the period of private preview and we'll communicate that when we do.  
*	Private preview is expected to run for a few months. We appreciate your active participation and plan to consider all relevant feedback in developing future releases.  
*	Reach out to your assigned program manager first or use the email, **[pirequest@microsoft.com](mailto:pirequest@microsoft.com)**, to provide feedback and report issues. We'll use reasonable effort to triage reported issues, prioritize them, track them, and share their status with you regularly.

*	Access to a test environment for [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/) to test the integration of data.

## Private preview capabilities

### First-run experience

The starting point for any user is signing into the engagement insights capability in which the organization is generated and your own environment and projects are created. This is where you'll be able to start ingesting your web analytics data.

### Web SDK

The JavaScript library for your website to measure user interaction with the provided sample code.

### Web analytics and reports

The out-of-the-box reports show the events coming through from the Web SDK with predefined visualizations and dashboards.

### Refined events

The capability to create a refined event from the web analytics data, filter it, and export it to your Data Lake Storage. The exported data in Data Lake Storage can be imported into an engagement insights capability as a data source.
