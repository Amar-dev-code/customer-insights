title: Engagement insights preview ends
summary: The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability preview ended February 15, 2022. This change means the Customer Insights trial experience no longer includes the ability to create funnels nor other reporting functionality. We invite you to explore and evaluate the many other features of Customer Insights, the Microsoft Customer Data Platform (CDP). Please contact your Microsoft Account team directly if you have questions about the end of the capability preview. Your Account Team will keep you up to date on upcoming launches. Thank you!
