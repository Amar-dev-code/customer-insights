title: Engagement insights preview ends
summary: The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability preview ended February 15, 2022. This change means the Customer Insights trial experience no longer includes the ability to create funnels nor other reporting functionality. We invite you to explore and evaluate the many other features of Customer Insights, the Microsoft Customer Data Platform (CDP).   
 
Existing preview users still have access to many preview capabilities and functionality including:
 
•	Get code to instrument a web site or mobile app 
•	See ingested and refined events and view the event properties 
•	Enhance unified profiles with ingested and refined events Customers can benefit from the full value of their customer data, informing their decision-making, campaigns, and activations and can continue to leverage integrations with their existing digital analytics solutions. 

Please contact your Microsoft Account team directly if you have questions about the end of the capability preview. Your Account Team will keep you up to date on upcoming launches. 

Thank you!
