# Workspaces and members

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A workspace is how you group data and reports in Dynamics 365 Customer Insight engagement insights capability. It's where you can view user activity in real time. You can add members to an existing project at any time. 

## Create a workspace

2. Enter a name for your workspace in the **Name** box and optionally add text in **Description**.

3. Choose **Create** to confirm and create the workspace.


## Add members

The **Members** page is where you can assign members to your projects, and define their roles and permissions.
