# Workspace and members

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A workspace is how you can view user activity in real time to better understand your audience. It's where you store and manage events and reports.

When you create a workspace, you select the type of data that you want to focus on. You can add other users, or members, to an existing workspace at any time.  During public preview, engagement insights capability only supports web workspaces.

## Create a workspace

The process of creating a workspace includes setting up the *environment* to organize your workspace. An environment is space that can contain one or more workspaces. You can use an environment to manage your workspaces and connections to Customer Insights audience insights capability.

1. Choose the type of environment you want, enter an **Environment name**, and select **Next**.
1. Enter a **Workspace name** and select **Next**.
1. Select **Finish** if you're done. 
1. If you want to add members to the workspace, enter a name in the **Members** box. You can search by name or email address.

## Add members

After you create a workspace, you can add members and define their roles and permissions on the **Members** page.
