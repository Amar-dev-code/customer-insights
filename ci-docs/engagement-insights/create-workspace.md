# Create a new workspace and add members

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A workspace is how you can view user activity in real time to better understand your audience. It's where you store and manage events and reports.

When you create a workspace, you select the type of data that you want to focus on. You can add other users, or members, to an existing workspace at any time. 

## Create a new workspace

The process of creating a workspace includes setting up the *environment* to organize your workspace. An environment is space that can contain one or more workspaces. You can use an environment to manage your workspaces and connections to Customer Insights audience insights capability.

1. Select **New** from the workspace switcher.

   - Toggle **Filter bot traffic** to "enabled" to remove web traffic by bots for this workspace. 

1. Select **Complete** when you're done.
