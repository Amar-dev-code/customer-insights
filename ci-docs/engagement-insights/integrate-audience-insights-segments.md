# Use audience insights segments to filter engagement insights reports

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
<!--note from editor: Via MWSG, we want to avoid "enables" and "lets."-->
With engagement insights, you can use audience insights segments in interactive analyses of behavioral data captured by engagement insights on your websites.<!--note from editor: I assume that the audience is the customer here?-->

## Prerequisite

- An engagement insights environment in which you have audience insights segments data linked to the audience insights environment where the segments and customer profiles are created. More information: [Create a link between audience insights and engagement insights](integrate-audience-insights-engagement-insights.md)

## Create audience insights segments 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For audience insights segments to show up in engagement insights, you must first [run merge and downstream processes](../audience-insights/merge-entities.md). Downstream processes are important because they generate a unique table that prepares audience insights segments to be shared with engagement insights. (If a system refresh is scheduled, it will automatically include downstream processes.)

You can use audience insights segments in engagement insights out-of-the-box reports or custom reports you've created.<!--note from editor: Suggested.--> For more information, go to [Out-of-box profile reports](profile-reports.md) and [Create and edit custom reports](custom-reports.md).

**To use audience insights segments in engagement insights reports**

1. From your **Workspace** page, select **Data**, and then select the **Segments** tab.

   >[!NOTE]
   > Selecting an audience insights segment takes you to audience insights, where you can find out how that segment was created in terms of the rules and logic. For more information about audience insights segments, go to [View and create segments](../audience-insights/segments.md).

2. Select an out-of-the-box report or [create a custom report](custom-reports.md), and then select **Add condition**. (For this example, we chose the **Page views** report.)

    :::image type="content" source="media/integrate-audience-insights-segments2.png" alt-text="Add a condition.":::

3. Select **Filter by segment**, expand the **Segment type** list, and then select **Demographic**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integrate-audience-insights-segments3.png" alt-text="Select the Demographic segment type.":::

4. Expand the **Segment name** list, and then choose an audience insights segment.

    :::image type="content" source="media/integrate-audience-insights-segments4.png" alt-text="Choose a segment.":::

5. You can apply one or more segments, including behavioral (engagement insights) and demographic (audience insights) segments. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/integrate-audience-insights-segments6.png" alt-text="Page views report restricted to the USA customers and Homepage segments.":::

In the preceding image, the **USA customers** and **Homepage** segments have been selected, which restricts the **Page views** report to display only those two segments.

> You can use audience insights segments to filter out-of-the-box reports, custom reports, and funnels in engagement insights.
