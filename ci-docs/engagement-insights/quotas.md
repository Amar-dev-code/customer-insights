# Workspace and event quotas (public preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Engagement insights is a highly scalable application that can support millions of events per second. During public preview, events have a volume threshold. There's also a limit to the number of workspaces in an organization.

## Engagement insights limits

- Maximum event volume per workspace  = 100 events per second

- Maximum number of workspaces per organization = 100

When events exceed the threshold, it can lead to loss of data in reports based on those events. You can [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2145734) to request a  volume increase before you exceed limits. We'll work with you to determine your need for a volume increase and support your request.
