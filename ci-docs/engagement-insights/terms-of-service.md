# MICROSOFT DYNAMICS 365 CUSTOMER INSIGHTS – Engagement insights (preview) 

Engagement insights (preview) is a pre-release preview capability, which means that it has less or different security, privacy, and data location measures than the features and capabilities that are made generally available in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. Review the terms below and the product documentation to determine if engagement insights (preview) is appropriate for your data.

## PREVIEW TERMS OF SERVICE

LAST UPDATED OCTOBER 2020 

By accessing or using the services preview of the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Engagement insights (together with any Microsoft provided data sources, the “Services”), you accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not accept them, do not access or use the Services.

## 1. WHAT THIS AGREEMENT COVERS

This is an agreement between you (“you,” “your,” “Customer,” “Participant,” or “Licensee”) and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft, “we,” “us”, or “our”). The terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement”) apply to your access and use of Services. For clarity, the Services covered by this Agreement include only Customer Insights – Engagement insights, and not other features or functionality of Customer Insights, including but not limited to Audience insights. The Services are optional evaluation services to obtain feedback prior to general release.  

Certain Microsoft services or software may be necessary to use the Services (“Required Offerings”). Microsoft does not grant any rights under this Agreement to access or use Required Offerings. Rather, Required Offerings are separately licensed under any respective Microsoft Licensing Agreement, and may require paying a fee. If you are a subscriber of Dynamics 365 or other Microsoft services, your Dynamics 365 customer agreement or other Microsoft service agreement applies to your use of Dynamics 365 or other Microsoft services generally. This Agreement applies to your use of the Services specifically.  

“Microsoft Licensing Agreement” or “MLA” means the Microsoft Online Services Terms (see http://microsoftvolumelicensing.com/) and Participant’s Microsoft volume licensing agreement, or any other applicable agreement, under which Participant subscribed or was granted a license to any Required Offerings. 

## 2. THE SERVICES

### 2.1. Pre-Release Services and Updates

You acknowledge that: 

(i) The Services provided under this Agreement are in a pre-release stage and are only available for a limited time. (ii) The Services may not work correctly or the way a commercial version of the Services may function. (iii) The Services may experience interruptions and extended downtime during which you may not be able to access Customer Data or other functionality. (iv) Updates may be provided throughout the term and such updates may result in deleting the Customer Data or changing of Services functionality. (v) In general, due to the pre-release nature of the Services, some or all of the Customer Data may be lost. (vi) Your Customer Data may not be migrated from the Services to any future pre-release or commercial versions that may be released. (vii) Microsoft may choose not to make the Services generally available. (viii) You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Services and assume all risks associated with using the Services, including but not limited to risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

### 2.2. Future Releases

Microsoft may change the Services at any time, including without limitation for a future pre-release or commercial version, and we may not release a future pre-release or commercial version.  

### 2.3. Pre-release Limitations

Because of their pre-release status, the Services may employ lesser or different privacy and security measures than those typically present in a Microsoft enterprise online service.  You may not use the Services to process other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements.   

### 2.4. Access and Use Rights

You may access and use the Services only through the means we designate for the Services and only in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the policies and procedures we designate for use of the Services.

## 3. DATA

“GDPR” means Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons about the Processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data. The terms “Personal Data,” “Data Subject,” “Controller,” “Personal Data Breach,” “Processor,” “Processing,” and “Supervisory Authority” have meaning as defined in the GDPR or other applicable law. “Subprocessor” means a Processor appointed by another Processor.

### 3.2 Processing of Personal Data; GDPR

To the extent Microsoft is a Processor or Subprocessor of Personal Data in connection with the Services, any such Personal Data will be subject to Microsoft’s commitments relating to “Professional Services Data” in the Online Services Terms and Online Services Data Protection Addendum. You agree that you have appropriate consents from any data subjects for the transfer, storage, and processing of Personal Data in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.

### 4.3. Customer Data

You represent, and agree to ensure, that you have the necessary rights to any Customer Data, including Personal Data, software programs or services that you use in connection with the Services, and that such activities do not infringe or violate the intellectual property, personal or other proprietary rights of any third party. You agree to obtain all necessary rights, and comply with all licenses or other terms, from the rightful owner of such Customer Data, software programs or services that you do not own. You agree to access or use the Services (a) without purporting to subject Microsoft to any other obligations to you or any third party, and (b) solely in a manner that complies with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Microsoft will solely own any enhancements or improvements to the Services arising from access to and use of Customer Data. Microsoft may also use information derived from Customer Data if such use does not include Customer Data and no Customer Data can be reverse engineered from such use.

## 5. NO SUPPORT

We have no obligation to provide any support services for the Services. The Services may be inaccessible due to scheduled and unscheduled reasons, including maintenance updates, power outages, system failures, extended downtime, and other interruptions. During such periods, you may be unable to access or use all of, or a portion of, the Services. Some or all of the Customer Data may be lost. In the event of an outage or interruption that Microsoft determines may cause risk to the Services, Microsoft may determine in its sole discretion to suspend the Services.

We reserve all other rights to such Software. You may not disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any such Software included in the Services, except and only to the extent that the law expressly permits this activity.

## 7. FEEDBACK

If you give feedback about the Services to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any intellectual property rights needed for their products, technologies, and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive expiration or termination of this agreement.

## 8. PUBLICITY

In connection with the Services, Microsoft may create documentation, films, photographs, referrals, quotations, or other recordings or materials (“Publicity Materials”). Any Publicity Materials will be identified in advance and mutually agreed to, and the following provisions shall apply only to the extent we agree to specific Publicity Materials.

You grant Microsoft the non-exclusive right to use your name, trademarks and service marks, and logos (“Marks”) in such Publicity Materials.

### 8.2. Approvals

You will have the right to approve, before Microsoft’s first use, any Publicity Materials that include Marks or Name and Likeness. You will promptly review and either approve or disapprove them (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) within five business days of receipt. Failure to respond within such five-day period will be deemed approval. You are solely responsible for bringing to Microsoft’s attention any factual errors or removing your Confidential Information from Publicity Materials.

## 9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICES (IF ANY) "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS UNDER OR IN RELATION TO THE SERVICES OR SUPPORT SERVICES (IF ANY). TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE NOT FAULT-FREE AND OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. MICROSOFT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT DATA LOSS WON'T OCCUR.

## 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MICROSOFT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR THAT RELATE IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS PERFORMANCE. THIS EXCLUSION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED, WHETHER MICROSOFT HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, OR WHETHER APPLICATION OF THE EXCLUSION CAUSES ANY REMEDY TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. MICROSOFT’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED  U.S. $5.00. THIS CAP APPLIES WHETHER THE CLAIM IS IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE.

Microsoft may suspend or cancel your use of and access to all or any part of the Services, or terminate this Agreement, at any time for any reason and in its sole discretion.
