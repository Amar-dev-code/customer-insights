# Get started with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability (public preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Engagement insights capability lets you collect and measure customer behavior on your website. It integrates with audience insights capability so you can see rich real-time behavioral analytics alongside customer profile reports. The links in this article help you quickly configure and set up your environment.

## Step 1: Review prerequisites

First, you must have an active Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) user account. Then, read the following articles before setting up an engagements insights workspace.

- Review and agree to the [Terms of service](terms-of-service.md) with Microsoft.  
- Read the [Manage cookies and user consent](user-consent-storage.md) article. Afterwards, evaluate whether you need to update your user consent notification. If you previously had no "non-essential" cookies, you'll likely need to update your site policy.
- Review the [glossary](glossary.md) for a quick introduction to key terms and concepts.

## Step 2: Explore engagement insights

The first time you visit engagement insights you can configure settings, review policies, and explore the capability.

1. Sign in the [engagement insights capability portal](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/app/engagement-insights) using your Microsoft AAD user (school or work) account.

1. Select your region, and check the box if you want to opt in to receive email updates and offers.

1. Review the **engagement insights (preview) Terms of use** and **Privacy statement**, and then select **Explore the demo** to accept these settings.

1. Explore the product using a set of sample data.

##  Step 3: Set up a workspace and add code to your website

A workspace is where you can view user activity in real time, and store and manage reports. Add code to your website to start collecting *events*, the activity data that comes in from users.

1. [Create a workspace](create-workspace.md) and add members.

1. [Add code to your website](instrument-website.md) or [mobile app](developer-resources.md#capture-events-from-mobile-apps) to see user activity arriving into your workspace.

1. View a [real-time report](view-reports.md) that shows active users by browser, device, operating system, location, and language. You can also create [custom reports](custom-reports.md) to create your own visualizations.
	
## Step 4: Export data to other channels

You can create *refined events* (a virtual view) of your web analytics data. Then filter and export the data to Azure Data Lake Storage. You can ingest the exported data as a data source. For more information, see [Create a link between audience insights and engagement insights](integrate-audience-insights-engagement-insights.md).

1. [Create refined events](refined-events.md) for export.

1. [Export the data](export-events.md) to Data Lake Storage.

1. [Create a link between audience insights and engagement insights](integrate-audience-insights-engagement-insights.md) to share data between the two capabilities.

1. Learn how to [delete and export event data containing personal information](delete-export-personal-data.md).
