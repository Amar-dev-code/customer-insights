# Create and modify events

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

An event is data that represents user behavior, like activity on a website.

- A *base* event records when a user views a page (view event) or interacts with content (action event).
- A *refined* event is a virtual view of a base event. You define refined events by removing and adding properties or by filtering events based on property values.

## Prerequisites

To get events, your website data needs to first be connected to engagement insights with a code snippet. For more information, see [Install the web SDK on a website](instrument-website.md).

## Create refined events

Use refined events to reduce the scope of a base event for [export](export-events.md) or to remove properties that aren't necessary for exposure.

> [!NOTE]
> Once you add the web SDK to your website, you can view your base events and create refined events. 

To view your base events:

1. Go to **Data** in the left navigation pane.

1. Select **Events** to see a list of all the events in the workspace.

To create a refined event from a base event: 

1. Go to **Data** > **Events** and select **+ New events** at the top of the screen.

1. In the **New events** dialog, select **Create refined events** and then select **Next**.
   
     :::image type="content" source="media/new-events-wizard.png" alt-text="New events wizard.":::
     
1. In the **New events** dialog, enter the following information:

   - Select an event from the **Base events** dropdown.
   - Enter a name in the **Refined events display name** box.
   - Optionally, update the suggested **Actual name** without using spaces.

1. Select **Create** to apply your settings.

The refined event now appears in your **Events** list.

### Edit event name

You can change the name and the properties of a base or refined event.

1. Go to **Data** > **Events**.

### View the details of a refined event:

1. In the **Event** list, select your base or refined event. 

1. Select **Add and remove properties** at the top of the screen to open the **Edit properties** pane.

1. Use the check boxes to select the properties that you want to show and the ones you want to hide. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/edit-properties-refined-events.png" alt-text="Edit properties for refined events.":::

1. Select **Confirm** to apply your selection, and then select **Save**.
