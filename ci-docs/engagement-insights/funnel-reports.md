# Create and manage funnel reports

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A funnel report collects information about the steps that occur during a customer journey through your website or mobile app. It helps you understand how an audience progresses through a process and identifies drop-off points. For example, you can use a funnel report to identify paths your customers take before they make a purchase. A funnel report provides data to inform decisions and identify areas for optimization and process improvements.

## Create a funnel report

To create the funnel report, specify the steps that you want to include and the activity for each step. An activity is an [event](glossary.md) that represents user behavior. The funnel report displays the number of users who completed each defined step. 

1. Go to **Funnels** and select **+New funnel** to start a funnel report.

1. In the **Funnel Editor**, under **Steps** select **+Add step.** 

1. Enter a name in  **Step title**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-funnel-report.png" alt-text="New funnel report.":::

1. Select an **Activity**. An activity records when a user views a page (**View** activity) or interacts with content (**Action** activity).

1. Use **Step criteria** to specify the activity's dimension. [Dimensions](dimensions.md) are attributes that can describe, filter, or group data.

1. Optionally, you can configure multi-condition funnel steps. Select **Add condition** to specify more dimensions in a step. Additional criteria must use the same activity type. You can choose if multiple conditions are connected with an AND or an OR operator.

1. Select **Add step** until you complete all the steps you want in the report.

1. Select **Save**, name the report, and **Save** again. 

### Example: Fourth Coffee company funnel report

The following scenario demonstrates one way of using a funnel report. An analyst with the Fourth Coffee company wants to understand the influence of a recent promotion on subscription rates. The analyst creates a funnel report to identify customer activity. It starts when customers arrive on the company home page until they use the subscription promotion code. The analyst creates a funnel report with the following steps:

Step 1: Customers who land on the homepage   
Step 2: Customers who make a purchase   
Step 3: Customers who use the promotion code to get a discount on a subscription   
Step 4: Subscription sign-up   

:::image type="content" source="media/funnel-report-example.png" alt-text="funnel report example.":::
  
This funnel lets you see the number of users who used the promotion code after a one-time purchase to sign up for the subscription program.

### Configure advanced settings 

Funnel reports let you define a limit on the time it takes to complete a funnel. For example, you can set the time to complete the funnel to four days. This setting will only count successful subscription sign-ups that occurred within four days of a user visiting the homepage.

1. Go to **Funnels** to open the **Funnels library**.

1. Select a name to open the report. 

1. In the **Funnel Editor** pane, select **Advanced settings**. 

1. Set Limit funnel completion time to **On**.
