# Create and modify refined events

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A refined event is a virtual view of a base event. Generally, use refined events to reduce the scope of a base event for [export](export-events.md) or to remove properties that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

You can define refined events by removing and adding properties or by filtering events based on property values.

## Create a refined event

There are three ways to create a refined event from a base event. Select **Admin**> **Data** > **Events** and choose one of the following options:

1. Select **+ Add events** and choose **Create refined event**.
1. Select **...** from the table row containing a base event, and then select **Create refined event** from the drop-down menu.
1. Select a base event to open a detailed view, and then select **Create a refined event** from the top menu.

## Modify a refined event

Once created, you're taken to a detailed view of your new refined event. By default, this event has the same properties as your base event.

### Add and remove properties

1. From the detailed view of your refined event, select **Add and remove properties** to open the **Edit properties** pane. 
2. Use the check boxes to select the properties that you want to show and the ones you want to hide. 
3. Select **Confirm** to apply your selection.

### Rename properties

1. From the detailed view of your refined event, select the arrow next to a property, and then select **Edit name** from the drop-down menu. 
2. Enter a new name and select **Confirm** to apply your changes.

> [!TIP]
> Renaming doesn't change the initial property. It creates a copy with a new name and hides the original from view. You can use the **Add and remove** properties menu to access the original property.

## Filter properties

1. From the detailed view of your refined event, select the arrow next to a property, and then select **Add filters** from the drop-down menu.
2. Select **+ Add filter** and choose an operation and a value. If you add multiple filters to an event, they're connected with a logical "AND" operator. 
3. Select **Confirm** to apply the filters.

You see a filter icon next to the property's name in the detailed view if filters are successfully added.
