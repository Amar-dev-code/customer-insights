This list defines selected terms that appear in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and in its supporting documentation.


## Events

Data is sent to the engagement insights capability from an outside source, such as a website, mobile app, or Internet of Things (IoT) device. Events provide a continuous flow of data that you can analyze for real-time insight into how customers use and experience your product. An event is a single occurrence of data sent to engagement insights capability. If you think of an **event** as a flowing stream of data, an event is that stream at a specific moment.
## Member

A member of a workspace is a user in the engagement insights capability who can access a workspace. Members can have roles. Currently, “Owner” is the only role available in engagement insights capability. It allows the user to manage the workspace and its data, and to view reports.

## Metric

A quantifiable measurement of data, used to track or assess a process. Page views and average time spent on site are examples of relevant metrics.

## Report

A collection of data visualizations. Engagement insights capability includes several predefined reports for web projects.


## Workspace

A grouping of data and reports in engagement insights capability. New workspaces include pre-configured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.
