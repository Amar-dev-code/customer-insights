# Engagement insights capability glossary

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and in its supporting documentation.

## Base event

A base event is a set of data representing activity on a website, such as a page view or click. 

## Dimensions

Dimensions are attributes of events that can describe, filter, or group data. For example, you can select *operating system (OS)*, *browser*, or *page name* as a dimension in a report.

## Event

In digital analytics, an event represents user behavior. An event records when a user views a page (view event) or interacts with content (action event). Activity data from your website is captured as *base events*. For reporting, you can decide the properties of the data that you want display. This virtual view of the data is called a *refined event*. 

## Environment

 An environment is a space that can contain one or more workspaces. You can use an environment to manage your workspaces and connections to Customer Insights audience insights capability.

## Member

A member of a workspace is a user who can access a workspace. Members can have roles, which allow the user to manage the workspace, its data, and view reports. Currently, *Owner* is the only role available in engagement insights capability.

## Metric

A metric is a quantifiable measurement of data used to track or assess a process. Page views and average time spent on site are examples of relevant metrics.

## Refined event

A refined event is a virtual view of a base event filtered by specific properties of the data. Use refined events to simplify a base event for export or to remove properties from an event that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Report

A report is a collection of data visualizations that help you measure and understand user behavior. Engagement insights capability includes several predefined reports for web projects. You can also create custom reports. 

## Workspace

A workspace is how you store and manage events and reports. It's where you can view user activity in real time. When you create a workspace, you select the type of data you will send to the workspace.
