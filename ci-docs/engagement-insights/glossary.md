# Engagement insights capability glossary

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This list defines selected terms that appear in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and in its supporting documentation.

## Events

In digital analytics, an event represents user behavior. An event records when a user views a page (view event) or interacts with content (action event).  On a web page, as visitors view web pages, engagements insights sends page view events. As they interact with web page elements, it sends page action events.

## Member

A member of a workspace is a user in the engagement insights capability who can access a workspace. Members can have roles. Currently, “Owner” is the only role available in engagement insights capability. It allows the user to manage the workspace and its data, and to view reports.

## Metric

A metric is a quantifiable measurement of data used to track or assess a process. Page views and average time spent on site are examples of relevant metrics.

## Refined event

A refined event is a virtual view of a base event. Use refined events to simplify a base event for export or to remove properties from an event that aren't necessary for exposure or export.

## Report

A report is a collection of data visualizations. Engagement insights capability includes several predefined reports for web projects.

## Workspace

A grouping of data and reports. New workspaces include pre-configured reports and insights based on the type of product you want to analyze.
