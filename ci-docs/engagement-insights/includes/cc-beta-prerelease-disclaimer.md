> The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability preview ended February 15, 2022.  
>
>This change means the Customer Insights trial experience no longer includes the ability to create funnels nor other reporting functionality.
>
> We invite you to explore and evaluate the many other features of [Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-insights/), the Microsoft customer data platform (CDP).    
>  
> For a transition period, existing preview participants still have access to some preview capabilities and functionality:
> 
> - Get code to instrument a web site or mobile app 
> - See events and event properties 
> - Enhance unified profiles with ingested and refined events to benefit from the full value of their customer data
>  
> Note: During the transition period, captured events are still streamed to the connected Data Lake. Once this functionality is turned off, data sharing between engagement insights and audience insights will stop and no new events are sent to the connected storage.
>
> Please contact your Microsoft Account team directly if you have questions about the end of the capability preview. Your Account team will keep you up to date on coming launches. 
>
>Thank you!
