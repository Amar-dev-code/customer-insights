# Roles and permissions

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can assign members to your workspace and define their roles and permissions. Engagement insights capability supports **Environment admin** and **Workspace admin** roles.

## Permissions
  
The following chart identifies permissions for each role. 

| Permission | Environment admin | Workspace admin |
|--|--|--|
| Create environments (creator automatically becomes environment admin) | X* | X* |  |
| Configure environment (environment members, delete environment) | X |  |  |
| Create workspaces | X |  |  |
| Configure workspaces (workspace members, pre-defined reports, delete workspace) | X | X |  |
| Configure events and refined events | X | X |
| View workspace events and refined events | X | X |
| View workspace resources (reports, segments, and metric)| X | X |

*Can only create trial environments in preview.
