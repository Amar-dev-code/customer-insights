# Quickstart for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article explains how to create an engagement insights instance and set up an environment.

## Sign up and create a workspace

1. In your browser, go to the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://pi.dynamics.com/) website. Create a new account, or sign in with your existing credentials.
2. Once signed in, you'll see the **Get started with engagement insights capability!** dialog box. Select your current region, and use the check box to indicate whether you want to opt in to receive updates and offers via email.
3. Review the **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability Preview terms of service** and **Privacy Statement**, and then select **Next** to accept them.
4. Select the type of activity that you want your project to measure. Currently, **Website activity** is the only available choice. **App activity** and **Device activity** will become available in future releases. Select **Next** to confirm and create the project.
5. You'll see a success message, and a code snippet that must be added to your website to start receiving data in  engagement insights capability. You can implement this right away, or **share the code** and instructions for implementing it with your webmaster via email. You can always find this code again later by going to **Admin** > **Data** > **Code** in engagement insights capability.
6. Select **Done** to go to your workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data will not show in the workspace until the code has been implemented on your website.
