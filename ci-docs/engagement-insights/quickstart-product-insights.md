# Quickstart for private preview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer]( ../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article explains how to create a Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability instance and how to set up an environment.

## Sign up for  Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability and create a project

1. In your browser, go to the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://pi.dynamics.com/) website. Create a new account, or sign in with your existing credentials.
2. Once signed in, you'll see the **Get started with engagement insights capability!** dialog box. Select your current region, and use the check box to indicate whether you want to opt in to receive updates and offers via email.
3. Review the **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights engagement insights capability Preview terms of service** and **Privacy Statement**, and then select **Next** to accept them.
4. Select the type of activity that you want your project to measure. Currently, **Website activity** is the only available choice. **App activity** and **Device activity** will become available in future releases. Select **Next** to confirm and create the project.
5. You'll see a success message, and a code snippet that must be added to your website to start receiving data in  engagement insights capability. You can implement this right away, or **share the code** and instructions for implementing it with your webmaster via email. You can always find this code again later by going to **Admin** > **Data** > **Code** in engagement insights capability.
6. Select **Done** to go to your engagement insights capability instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data will not show in engagement insights capability until the code has been implemented on your website.

## Add members to an existing project

By default, only the person who created the  engagement insights capability instance will have access. You can add other users from your organization to an existing project at any time.
