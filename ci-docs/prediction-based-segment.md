# Create a segment based on a prediction model (preview)

The results of predictions sometimes only apply to a subset of your customers. Increase the personalization of recommendations by creating segments from results of prediction models. For example, you may want to give specific recommendations to customers that prefer a certain type of service. 

## Prerequisites

- At least [Contributor permissions](permissions.md) in Customer Insights.

- A product recommendation, transactional churn, subscription churn, or customer lifetime value model configured in Customer Insights. Review the requirements to set up the different models:

  - [Product recommendation model](predict-product-recommendation.md)
  - [Subscription churn model](predict-subscription-churn.md)
  - [Transactional churn model](predict-transactional-churn.md)
  - [Customer lifetime value model](predict-customer-lifetime-value.md)

## Create a customer segment based on predictions

1. Go to **Intelligence** > **Predictions** and select the **My predictions** tab.

1. Select the vertical ellipses next to the model you want to review and select **View**.

1. On the results page, select **Create segment**. For more information about the results page, review the article about the model.
