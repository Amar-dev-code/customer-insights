# Export segments to SendGrid (preview)

Export segments of unified customer profiles to SendGrid contact lists and use them for campaigns and email marketing in SendGrid. 

## Prerequisites for a connection

-	You have a [SendGrid account](https://sendgrid.com/) and corresponding administrator credentials.
-	There are existing contact lists in SendGrid and the corresponding IDs. For more information, see [SendGrid - Manage contacts](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#manage-contacts).
-	You have [configured segments](segments.md) in Customer Insights.
-	Unified customer profiles in the exported segments contain a field representing an email address.

## Known limitations

- Up to 100'000 customer profiles in total to SendGrid.
- Exporting to SendGrid is limited to segments.
- Exporting up to 100'000 customer profiles to SendGrid can take up to a few hours to complete. 
- The number of customer profiles that you can export to SendGrid is dependent and limited on your contract with SendGrid.

## Set up connection to SendGrid

1. Go to **Admin** > **Connections**.

1. Select **Add connection** and choose **SendGrid** to configure the connection.

1. Give your connection a recognizable name in the **Display name** field. The name and the type of the connection describe this connection. We recommend choosing a name that explains the purpose and target of the connection.

1. Choose who can use this connection. If you take no action, the default will be Administrators. For more information, see [Allow contributors to use a connection for exports](connections.md#allow-contributors-to-use-a-connection-for-exports).

1. Enter your **SendGrid API key** [SendGrid API key](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).

1. Select **I agree** to confirm the **Data privacy and compliance**.

1. Select **Connect** to initialize the connection to SendGrid.

1. Select **Add yourself as export user** and provide your Customer Insights credentials.

1. Select **Save** to complete the connection.

## Configure an export

You can configure this export if you have access to a connection of this type. For more information, see [Permissions needed to configure an export](export-destinations.md#set-up-a-new-export).

1. Go to **Data** > **Exports**.

1. To create a new export, select **Add destination**.

1. In the **Connection for export** field, choose a connection from the SendGrid section. If you don't see this section name, there are no connections of this type available to you.

1. Enter your **[SendGrid list ID](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#manage-contacts)**.

1. In the **Data matching** section, in the **Email** field, select the field that represents a customer's email address. Repeat the same steps for other optional fields such as **First name**, **Last name**, **Country/Region**, **State**, **City**, and **Post code**.

1. Select the segments you want to export. We strongly **recommend to not export more than 100'000 customer profiles in total** to SendGrid. 

1. Select **Save**.

Saving an export doesn't run the export immediately.

The export runs with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab). 
You can also [export data on demand](export-destinations.md#run-exports-on-demand). 

## Data privacy and compliance

When you enable Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to transmit data to SendGrid, you allow transfer of data outside of the compliance boundary for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, including potentially sensitive data such as Personal Data. Microsoft will transfer such data at your instruction, but you are responsible for ensuring that SendGrid meet any privacy or security obligations you may have. For more information, see [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=396732).
Your Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Administrator can remove this export destination at any time to discontinue use of this functionality.
