## Configure the bot

1. Go to **Admin** > **Export Destinations**.
1. On the Microsoft Teams tile, select **Set up**.
1. You're redirected to the **Apps** area in Teams. You can also open Teams and select **Apps** in the bottom-left corner or [get it from AppSource](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2124104) directly.
1. Search for **Customer Insights** and select the app.
1. Select **Add**.
1. After signing in to Customer Insights in Teams, you'll see a welcome message and can get started.

## Things you can do with the bot

The bot provides lookup capabilities for unified customer profiles.

- Enter **search** followed by a name, email address, or any other field on the unified customer profile that is added to the search and filter index.

  You'll get a card with up to 15 fields from the resulting customer profile. Multiple matches return a list of results where you can select a profile. You can add the search term in double quotes to look up an exact match.

- If your organization maintains multiple Customer Insights environments in the same organization, you can enter **switchinstance** to choose which environment you want to connect the bot to.

- Enter **help** to see a list of available commands for the bot.
