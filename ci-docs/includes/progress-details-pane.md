> [!TIP] 
> There are [statuses](system.md#status-definitions) for tasks and processes. Most processes depend on other upstream processes, such as data sources and data profiling [refreshes](system.md#refresh-processes). Select the status to open the **Progress details** pane and view the progress of the tasks. Under each task, you can select **See details** for more progress information, such as processing time, the last processing date, and any applicable errors and warnings associated with the task or process. You can use the **Entire workflow** toggle at the bottom of the panel to see other processes in the system.
